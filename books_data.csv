Dr. Seuss: American Icon,"Philip Nel takes a fascinating look into the key aspects of Seuss's career - his poetry, politics, art, marketing, and place in the popular imagination."" ""Nel argues convincingly that Dr. Seuss is one of the most influential poets in America. His nonsense verse, like that of Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear, has changed language itself, giving us new words like ""nerd."" And Seuss's famously loopy artistic style - what Nel terms an ""energetic cartoon surrealism"" - has been equally important, inspiring artists like filmmaker Tim Burton and illustrator Lane Smith. --from back cover",['Philip Nel'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IjvHQsCn_pgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=IjvHQsCn_pgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Dr.+Seuss:+American+Icon&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,A&C Black,2005-01-01,http://books.google.nl/books?id=IjvHQsCn_pgC&dq=Dr.+Seuss:+American+Icon&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],

Vector Quantization and Signal Compression (The Springer International Series in Engineering and Computer Science),"Herb Caen, a popular columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle, recently quoted a Voice of America press release as saying that it was reorganizing in order to ""eliminate duplication and redundancy. "" This quote both states a goal of data compression and illustrates its common need: the removal of duplication (or redundancy) can provide a more efficient representation of data and the quoted phrase is itself a candidate for such surgery. Not only can the number of words in the quote be reduced without losing informa tion, but the statement would actually be enhanced by such compression since it will no longer exemplify the wrong that the policy is supposed to correct. Here compression can streamline the phrase and minimize the em barassment while improving the English style. Compression in general is intended to provide efficient representations of data while preserving the essential information contained in the data. This book is devoted to the theory and practice of signal compression, i. e. , data compression applied to signals such as speech, audio, images, and video signals (excluding other data types such as financial data or general purpose computer data). The emphasis is on the conversion of analog waveforms into efficient digital representations and on the compression of digital information into the fewest possible bits. Both operations should yield the highest possible reconstruction fidelity subject to constraints on the bit rate and implementation complexity.","['Allen Gersho', 'Robert M.

Portraits of the Presidents: The National Portrait Gallery,"A striking collection of presidential portraits from the National Portrait Gallery, this volume encapsulates the spirit of the most powerful office in the world. America's Presidents showcases the nation's largest collection of portraits of all the presidents beyond the White House's own, capturing the permanent exhibition that lies at the heart of the Portrait Gallery's mission to tell the American story through the individuals who have shaped it. The book explores presidential imagery through portraits ranging from the traditional, such as the iconic and newly restored ""Lansdowne"" portrait of George Washington by Gilbert Stuart, to the contemporary, such as Elaine de Kooning's colorful depiction of John F. Kennedy. Many of the featured portraits reveal much about the sitter, such as the intimate rendering of an informal George W. Bush by Robert Anderson and the fanciful, mosaic-like Chuck Close image of Bill Clinton. Some tell us more about the artist, such as the likeness of Franklin Delano Roosevelt that Douglas Chandor planned to include in a larger work about peace that would commemorate Roosevelt's Yalta meeting with wartime Allied leaders Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin. Works in other media, including sculptures and daguerreotypes, round out the presidential collection. Lively narratives accompany each piece, exploring the president's background and biography as well as the work's artistic and historical significance. Taken together, the portraits are a powerful visual exploration of the history of the highest office in the land and the diverse men who have held it.",['National Portrait Gallery'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lRVHDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=lRVHDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Portraits+of+the+Presidents:+The+National+Portrait+Gallery&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Smithsonian Institution,2018-02-13,http://books.google.nl/books?id=lRVHDwAAQBAJ&dq=Portraits+of+the+Presidents:+The+National+Portrait+Gallery&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],
Voices from the Farm: Adventures in Community Living,"Twenty-five years ago, at the height of the counter-culture movement, several hundred hippies drove their school buses into southern Tennessee and founded America's largest, modern-day intentional community, The Farm. In its heyday, the community was home to over 1,200 optimistic young people and the young-at-heart. Their purpose for coming together was to experiment with alternative lifestyles that could help raise the standard of living for impoverished people around the world while conserving the planet's resources. The results of these experiments were not always predictable, but were always interesting, and created lasting bonds among community members that are still strong today. The Farm remains a vibrant, working environment for change. Why has it lasted so long?

The Battleship Bismarck,"The Bismarck is perhaps the most famous – and notorious – warship ever built. Completed in 1941, the 45,000-ton German battleship sank HMS Hood, the pride of the British Navy, during one of the most sensational encounters in naval history. Following the sinking, Bismarck was chased around the North Atlantic by many units of the Royal Navy. She was finally dispatched with gunfire and torpedoes on 27 May, less than five months after her completion. Her wreck still lies where she sank, 4,800m down and 960km off the west coast of France. Drawing on new research and technology, this edition is the most comprehensive examination of Bismarck ever published. It includes a complete set of detailed line drawings with fully descriptive keys and full-colour 3D artwork, supported by technical details, photographs and text on the building of the ship and a record of the ship's service history.",['Stefan Draminski'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nxttDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=nxttDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Battleship+Bismarck&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Bloomsbury Publishing,2018-09-20,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nxttDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],1.0

Scholars should not ignore these ""dark sides"" of politics, however unpleasant they may be, since they influence the world in a multitude of harmful ways. The first volume in this two-volume collection focuses on the history of underground neo-fascist networks in the post-World War II era; neo-fascist paramilitary and terrorist groups operating in Europe and Latin America in the 1960s and 1970s; and the manipulation of those and other terrorist organizations by the security forces of various states, both authoritarian and democratic. A range of global case studies are included, all of which focus on the lesser known activities of certain secular extremist milieus.

The Ground and Grammar of Theology,"The futures seems to be full of promise and excitement. Certainly at no time for nearly a millenium and a half has the opportunity for genuine theology been greater, since the ground has been cleared in the remarkable way of the old dualist and atomistic modes of thought that have plagued theology for centuries. It is, therefore, up to us as theologians to develop theology on its own proper ground in this scientific context, if only because this is the kind of life and culture, and the kind of theology that can support the message of the Gospel to mankind, as, in touch with the advances of natural science, theology comes closer and closer to a real understanding of the creation as it came from the hand of God.",['Thomas F.

Josef Fuchs on Natural Law (Moral Traditions series),"Appointed by Pope John XXIII to the Pontifical Commission on Population, Family, and Birth, Fuchs ultimately found himself disappointed in his three years of service and spent the next thirty years exploring a broad array of issues pivotal to a reconstruction of Roman Catholic natural law theory. This is the first full-length analysis of Fuchs's efforts. Beginning historically by looking at Fuchs's writings and beliefs before the Pontifical Commission appointment, including his defense of natural law during the ""situation ethics"" debates of the 50s and 60s, the concept of personal salvation, and the status of ""nature"" and ""human nature,"" Graham moves to the intellectual conversion that inspired Fuchs to reconsider his concepts following the commission appointment. From there, Graham engages in a sustained critique of Fuchs's natural theory, addressing both the strengths and weaknesses to be found there and suggest possible avenues of development that would make a positive contribution to the ongoing quest to rehabilitate the Roman Catholic natural law theory that continues to dominate the landscape of moral theology today.",['Mark Graham'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t1KlgtaPokMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=t1KlgtaPokMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Josef+Fuchs+on+Natural+Law+(Moral+Traditions+series)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Georgetown University Press,2002-10-25,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t1KlgtaPokMC&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],

THE SECULAR CITY -SECULARIZATION AND URBANIZATION IN THEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE,"The study of Augustine's political teachings has suffered from a history of misreadings, both ancient and modern. It is only in recent years that the traditional lines of 'Augustinian pessimism' have been opened to question. Scholars have begun to explore the broader lines of Augustine's political thought in his letters and sermons, and thus have been able to place his classic text, The City of God, in its proper context. The essays in this volume take stock of these recent developments and revisit old assumptions about the significance of Augustine of Hippo for political thought. They do so from many different perspectives, examining the anthropological and theological underpinnings of Augustine's thought, his critique of politics, his development of his own political thought, and some of the later manifestations or uses of his thought in the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and today. This new vision is at once more bracing, more hopeful, and more diverse than earlier readings could have allowed.","['John Doody', 'Kim Paffenroth', 'Kevin L.

Cinema and Soviet Society; From the Revolution To the Death of Stalin.,"The story of Soviet film over the period covered by Peter Kenez is central to the history of World Cinema. In this revised, updated paperback edition of his classic text, Peter Kenez explores the roots of Soviet cinema in the film heritage of pre-Revolutionary Russia, tracing the changes in content, style, technical means and production capacities generated by the Revolution of 1917; the constraints on form and subject imposed from the 1930s in the name of Socialist Realism; the relative freedom of expression accorded to film-makers during World War Two; and the extraordinary repression during the final years of Stalin era. Based on original research both in the former Soviet Union and elsewhere in the primary sources of Eastern Europe, this is the essential student text on the period which produced the major films of such 'greats' as Eisenstein, Vertov, Kuleshov, Pudovkin and many more.",['Peter Kenez'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t2U2zAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=t2U2zAEACAAJ&dq=Cinema+and+Soviet+Society%3B+From+the+Revolution+To+the+Death+of+Stalin.&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,I.B.

"God was in this place & I, i did not know: Finding self, spirituality, and ultimate meaning","God encourages us in his Word to give thanks in all things at all times. That’s not a mistake. When we choose to focus on things we are grateful for, we become happier people. Our satisfaction in life increases. Comparisons cease. Unnecessary pursuits pause. And we begin to notice the little things. The things that matter. Life. Breath. Connection. Kindness. Beauty. This is where we find God—our true happy place. As you reflect on these devotional entries, Scriptures, and prayers, refocus your perspective and begin to meditate on things that produce life and joy, that bring peace and comfort. Spend the beginning and end of your day with God, experiencing his goodness and being refreshed in his presence. Be encouraged as you take time to ponder how wonderfully unique and abundantly blessed you are. Evaluate each day in the light of God’s truth.

Cruel and Unusual (G K Hall Large Print Book Series (Cloth)),"Wanneer er in dit achtste deel in de Kay Scarpetta-serie tien lijken worden gevonden in Amerika en Engeland, lijkt er één dader te zijn. Maar hoe kan de moordenaar op twee plekken tegelijk zijn? Onnatuurlijke dood is het achtste boek uit de bloedstollende bestsellerserie rond patholoog-anatoom Kay Scarpetta van auteur Patricia Cornwell. Deze serie, bestaande uit meer dan 20 bloedstollende crimethrillers, betekende Patricia Cornwells doorbraak als grondlegger van de pathologisch-anatomische thriller. Negen gruwelijk verminkte lijken zijn er al gevonden: vijf in Ierland en vier in Amerika. Steeds wordt het lichaam gedumpt op een vuilnisbelt en steeds worden de ledematen afgesneden. Wie pleegt deze verschrikkelijke moorden? Wanneer een tiende lijk wordt gevonden, wordt patholoog-anatoom Kay Scarpetta opgeroepen om de zaak te onderzoeken. Alles lijkt erop dat een en dezelfde dader aan het werk is, maar is er echt sprake van dezelfde dader? Kay Scarpetta en rechercheur Pete Marino ontdekken steeds meer bewijsmateriaal dat wijst op een alomvattend complot, waardoor het gehele land in gevaar is... Patricia Cornwells werk over de vrouwelijke patholoog-anatoom Scarpetta is de bestverkochte thrillerserie ter wereld; alleen in Nederland en Vlaanderen zijn er al 1,5 miljoen exemplaren verkocht.

From Potter's Field,"The sixth book in the Kay Scarpetta series, from No. 1 bestselling author Patricia Cornwell. 'America's most chilling writer of crime fiction' The Times Christmas had never been a particularly good time for Dr Kay Scarpetta. Although a holiday for most, it always seem to heighten the alienation felt by society's violent fringe; and that usually means more work for Scarpetta, Virginia's Chief Medical Examiner. The body was naked, female and found propped against a fountain in a bleak area of New York's Central Park. Her apparent manner of death points to a modus operandi that is chillingly familiar: the gunshot wound to the head, the sections of skin excised from the body, the displayed corpse - all suggest that Temple Brooks Gault, Scarpetta's nemesis, is back at work. Calling on all her reserves of courage and skill, and the able assistance of colleagues Marino and Wesley, Scarpetta must track this most dangerous of killers in pursuit of survival as well as justice - heading inexorably to an electrifying climax amid the dark, menacing labyrinths of the New York subway.

Lincoln reconsidered;: Essays on the Civil War era,"A “brilliant” look at America’s sixteenth president by the New York Times–bestselling, Pulitzer Prize–winning author of Lincoln (American Historical Review). First published in 1956 and revised and updated for the twenty-first century, Lincoln Reconsidered is a masterpiece of Civil War scholarship. In a dozen eloquent, witty, and incisive essays, the author of the definitive biography of Abraham Lincoln offers a fresh perspective on topics previously shrouded in myth and hagiography and brings the president’s tough-mindedness, strategic acumen, and political flexibility into sharp focus. From Lincoln’s patchwork education to his contradictory interpretations of the Constitution and the legacy of the Founding Fathers, David Herbert Donald reveals the legal mind behind the legend of the Great Emancipator. “Toward a Reconsideration of the Abolitionists” sheds new light on the radicalism of the antislavery movement, while “Herndon and Mary Lincoln” brilliantly characterizes the complicated relationship between two of the president’s closest companions. “Getting Right with Lincoln” and “The Folklore Lincoln” draw on the methods of cultural anthropology to produce a provocative analysis of Lincoln as symbol. No historian has done more to enhance our understanding of Lincoln’s presidency and the causes and effects of the Civil War than Donald. Lincoln Reconsidered is an entertaining and accessible introduction to his work and a must-read for every student of American history.",['David Herbert Donald'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FkN_CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=FkN_CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Lincoln+reconsidered%3B:+Essays+on+the+Civil+War+era&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Open Road Media,2016-03-22,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FkN_CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],
Economics in one lesson,"With over a million copies sold, Economics in One Lesson is an essential guide to the basics of economic theory. A fundamental influence on modern libertarianism, Hazlitt defends capitalism and the free market from economic myths that persist to this day. Considered among the leading economic thinkers of the “Austrian School,” which includes Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist. He was the founding vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of The Freeman magazine, an influential libertarian publication. Hazlitt wrote Economics in One Lesson, his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy. Economic commentators across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication of Economics in One Lesson.

Important trees of the Ryukyu Islands (Tokubetsu hokoku),"This book challenges the conventional view of Japanese society as monocultural and homogenous. Unique for its historical breadth and interdisciplinary orientation, Multicultural Japan ranges from prehistory to the present, arguing that cultural diversity has always existed in Japan. A timely and provocative discussion of identity politics regarding the question of 'Japaneseness', the book traces the origins of the Japanese, examining Japan's indigenous people and the politics of archaeology, using the latter to link Japan's ancient history with contemporary debates on identity. Also examined are Japan's historical connections with Europe and East and Southeast Asia, ideology, family, culture and past and present.","['Donald Denoon', 'Mark Hudson', 'Gavan McCormack', 'Tessa Morris-Suzuki']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XUw6kiX9LQ0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=XUw6kiX9LQ0C&pg=PA115&dq=Important+trees+of+the+Ryukyu+Islands+(Tokubetsu+hokoku)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Cambridge University Press,2001-11-20,http://books.google.nl/books?id=XUw6kiX9LQ0C&dq=Important+trees+of+the+Ryukyu+Islands+(Tokubetsu+hokoku)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],

"A Prayer for the Government: Ukrainians and Jews in Revolutionary Times, 1917-1920 (Harvard Series in Ukrainian Studies)","Discusses the experiment in Jewish autonomy in Ukraine that began with the February democratic revolution in Russia, showing how common interests between Ukrainians and Jews, especially intellectuals, led to political rights for Jews. However, the experiment was a disastrous failure. One of the reasons was the failure to stem extensive pogroms in Ukraine. In contrast to the traditional post-1927 view that has considered the Ukrainian government as the instigator of most of the pogroms, concludes that Petlyura was responsible, by default, for not doing enough to stop the hooligans, while Jewish political leaders bore some responsibility for failure to agree on Jewish self-defense.",['Henry Abramson'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7sZtAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7sZtAAAAMAAJ&q=A+Prayer+for+the+Government:+Ukrainians+and+Jews+in+Revolutionary+Times,+1917-1920+(Harvard+Series+in+Ukrainian+Studies)&dq=A+Prayer+for+the+Government:+Ukrainians+and+Jews+in+Revolutionary+Times,+1917-1920+(Harvard+Series+in+Ukrainian+Studies)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Harvard Ukrainian,1999,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7sZtAAAAMAAJ&dq=A+Prayer+for+the+Government:+Ukrainians+and+Jews+in+Revolutionary+Times,+1917-1920+(Harvard+Series+in+Ukrainian+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api",['History'],
Islam and Mammon: The Economic Predicaments of Islamism,"The doctrine of ""Islamic economics"" entered debates over the social role of Islam in the mid-twentieth century. Since then it has pursued the goal of restructuring economies according to perceived Islamic teachings. Beyond its most visible practical achievement--the establishment of Islamic banks meant to avoid interest--it has promoted Islamic norms of economic behavior and founded redistribution systems modeled after early Islamic fiscal practices. In this bold and timely critique, Timur Kuran argues that the doctrine of Islamic economics is simplistic, incoherent, and largely irrelevant to present economic challenges. Observing that few Muslims take it seriously, he also finds that its practical applications have had no discernible effects on efficiency, growth, or poverty reduction. Why, then, has Islamic economics enjoyed any appeal at all? Kuran's answer is that the real purpose of Islamic economics has not been economic improvement but cultivation of a distinct Islamic identity to resist cultural globalization. The Islamic subeconomies that have sprung up across the Islamic world are commonly viewed as manifestations of Islamic economics. In reality, Kuran demonstrates, they emerged to meet the economic aspirations of socially marginalized groups. The Islamic enterprises that form these subeconomies provide advancement opportunities to the disadvantaged. By enhancing interpersonal trust, they also facilitate intragroup transactions. These findings raise the question of whether there exist links between Islam and economic performance. Exploring these links in relation to the long-unsettled question of why the Islamic world became underdeveloped, Kuran identifies several pertinent social mechanisms, some beneficial to economic development, others harmful.",['Timur Kuran'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VkIJGPNzVIIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=VkIJGPNzVIIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Islam+and+Mammon:+The+Economic+Predicaments+of+Islamism&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Princeton University Press,2010-12-16,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VkIJGPNzVIIC&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],

Compendium of Herbal Magick,"Every plant has its own distinct spiritual energy or its own deva. Devas are the radiant light of the Universal Divine that permeates all things. Since the earliest times, people were aware that all of Nature is divine. Great and wondrous myths were told that explained the presence of divine energy as it exists in thunder, in trees, and in sunlight. Some of this lore was the foundation of religions. But the simpler stories, such as those of a plant's energy, explored day-to-day matters like health and love. This understanding of the world has been preserved in folklore through poems, chants, ditties, and spells. From researching the history of folklore from cultures around the world, patterns emerge that enable us to approach the true nature of plants' devas. This compendium presents the lore and the corresponding usage for 330 magickal herbes. Great care was taken only to include folklore that was documented as authentic. You will meet many new herbes in this text and explore fascinating magickal and religi uses, but most of all, you will come to respect the divine that surrounds your everyday life.",['Paul Beyerl'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wA7xHAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=wA7xHAAACAAJ&dq=Compendium+of+Herbal+Magick&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Phoenix Publishing (WA),1998,http://books.google.nl/books?id=wA7xHAAACAAJ&dq=Compendium+of+Herbal+Magick&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Health & Fitness'],

It critically examines how these groups form and how they have evolved, their key personnel, their strategies and tactics, principles, motivating philosophies and attitudes to violence. Specifically, the book seeks to understand whether such groups inevitably evolve from activists to militants to terrorists, as the literature suggests. Lastly, it considers the future of such groups, asking whether they will become more prominent as more people become ecologically aware and as global environmental conditions deteriorate, or whether such groups have peaked as a force for environmental change.",['Gerry Nagtzaam'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_6jfDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=_6jfDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Eco-Terrorism&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Edward Elgar Publishing,2017-01-27,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_6jfDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Ecoterrorism'],

Deadville,"In the year 1833, two young brothers journey into the Wild West to seek their fortune; little do they know they’re embarking on the adventure of their lives. Expecting to stumble upon riches as they make their way westward, sixteen-year-old Dillon Griffith and his older brother Owen instead encounter hardship after hardship in the form of Indian raids, bloodthirsty villains, robbery, and kidnapping. With the help of a Shawnee trapper and scout, a runaway slave-turned–mountain man, and a beautiful American Indian warrior, the brothers battle the unexpected setbacks and obstacles that life in the West throws their way, and endeavor to find their place on the American frontier.Packed full of riveting action, gore, and vengeance, Deadville paints a thrilling—and historically pristine—picture of life in the Old West, from the physical environment to the social and economic milieus of frontier society.

Introduction To Mathematics for Life Scientists,"A few decades ago mathematics played a modest role in life sciences. Today, however, a great variety of mathematical methods is applied in biology and medicine. Practically every mathematical procedure that is useful in physics, chemistry, engineering, and economics has also found an important application in the life sciences. The past and present training of life scientists does by no means reflect this development. However, the impact ofthe fast growing number of applications of mathematical methods makes it indispensable that students in the life sciences are offered a basic training in mathematics, both on the undergraduate and the graduate level. This book is primarily designed as a textbook for an introductory course. Life scientists may also use it as a reference to find mathematical methods suitable to their research problems. Moreover, the book should be appropriate for self-teaching. It will also be a guide for teachers. Numerous references are included to assist the reader in his search for the pertinent literature.",['E.

On author Philip José Farmer’s Riverworld, humans from every era and culture have been simultaneously resurrected. Ancient Hebrews, medieval warriors, Spanish Inquisitors, and modern Americans intermingle in this strange new environment, but many still cling to old prejudices.

This volume includes the novelette “Riverworld,” along with two additional Riverworld tales and ten other short stories, all strange, clever, and profound. Farmer’s explorations of the wonderful and bizarre—from a portrayal of Jesus and Satan as cowpokes to a reimagining of Edgar Rice Burroughs’s Tarzan in the style of William Burroughs—plunge the reader into “one of the most imaginative worlds in science fiction” (Booklist).

Rodin in His Time: The Cantor Gifts to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art,"The sculpture of Auguste Rodin has become such an important part of our visual culture that it seems to have been with us always. The universal appeal of Rodin's work springs from its emotional expressiveness, its astonishingly lifelike vitality, and its passionate mirroring of the human condition. With his impressionistic technique, supported by a complete mastery of anatomical structure, Rodin overthrew the reigning academic precepts of finish and symmetry. By developing subjects beyond traditional allegories, he pointed the way to sheer abstraction in the twentieth century. This handsomely illustrated catalogue publishes for the first time in its entirety a major American collection of sculpture, the Cantor gifts to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and provides a rich context for Rodin's own work. It presents sculpture by Rodin's most important nineteenth-century forerunners--Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse, François Rude, and others--as well as work by the contemporaries he admired, those with whom he competed, those he influenced, and those who moved from his orbit to develop their own styles at the dawn of the twentieth century. But the centerpiece of the book remains Rodin: forty-two works by the most influential sculptor of the modern period, all specially photographed and many shown in multiple views. -- Publisher description.","['Los Angeles County Museum of Art', 'Mary L.

Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish,"""I had an obsession with the Amish. Plan and simple. Objectively it made no sense. I, who worked hard at being special, fell in love with a people who valued being ordinary."" So begins Sue Bender's story, the captivating and inspiring true story of a harried urban Californian moved by the beauty of a display of quilts to seek out and live with the Amish. Discovering lives shaped by unfamiliar yet comforting ideas about time, work, and community, Bender is gently coaxed to consider, ""Is there another way to lead a good life?"" Her journey begins in a New York men's clothing store. There she is spellbound by the vibrant colors and stunning geometric simplicity of the Amish quilts ""spoke directly to me,"" writes Bender. Somehow, ""they went straight to my heart."" Heeding a persistent inner voice, Bender searches for Amish families willing to allow her to visit and share in there daily lives. Plain and Simple vividly recounts sojourns with two Amish families, visits during which Bender enters a world without television, telephone, electric light, or refrigerators; a world where clutter and hurry are replaced with inner quiet and calm ritual; a world where a sunny kitchen ""glows"" and ""no distinction was made between the sacred and the everyday."" In nine interrelated chapters--as simple and elegant as a classic nine-patch Amish quilt--Bender shares the quiet power she found reflected in lives of joyful simplicity, humanity, and clarity. The fast-paced, opinionated, often frazzled Bender returns home and reworks her ""crazy-quilt"" life, integrating the soul-soothing qualities she has observed in the Amish, and celebrating the patterns in the Amish, and celebrating the patterns formed by the distinctive ""patches"" of her own life. Charmingly illustrated and refreshingly spare, Plain and Simple speaks to the seeker in each of us.",['Sue Bender'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4axy2kGahCEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=4axy2kGahCEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Plain+And+Simple+-+A+Woman%27s+Journey+To+The+Amish&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Harper Collins,2009-03-17,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4axy2kGahCEC&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],11.0

"Thomas Paine : Collected Writings : Common Sense / The Crisis / Rights of Man / The Age of Reason / Pamphlets, Articles, and Letters (Library of America)","Thomas Paine was the impassioned democratic voice of the Age of Revolution, and this volume brings together his best-known works: Common Sense, The American Crisis, Rights of Man, The Age of Reason, along with a selection of letters, articles and pamphlets that emphasizes Paine's American years. “I know not whether any man in the world,” wrote John Adams in 1805, “has had more influence on its inhabitants or affairs for the last thirty years than Tom Paine.” The impassioned democratic voice of the Age of Revolution, Paine wrote for his mass audience with vigor, clarity, and “common sense.” This Library of America volume is the first major new edition of his work in 50 years, and the most comprehensive single-volume collection of his writings available. Paine came to America in 1774 at age 37 after a life of obscurity and failure in England. Within fourteen months he published Common Sense, the most influential pamphlet for the American Revolution, and began a career that would see him prosecuted in England, imprisoned and nearly executed in France, and hailed and reviled in the American nation he helped create. In Common Sense, Paine set forth an inspiring vision of an independent America as an asylum for freedom and an example of popular self-government in a world oppressed by despotism and hereditary privilege. The American Crisis, begun during “the times that try men’s souls” in 1776, is a masterpiece of popular pamphleteering in which Paine vividly reports current developments, taunts and ridicules British adversaries, and enjoins his readers to remember the immense stakes of their struggle. Among the many other items included in the volume are the combative “Forester” letters, written in a reply to a Tory critic of Common Sense, and several pieces concerning the French Revolution, including an incisive argument against executing Louis XVI. Rights of Man (1791–1792), written in response to Edmund Burke’s attacks on the French Revolution, is a bold vision of an egalitarian society founded on natural rights and unbound by tradition. Paine’s detailed proposal for government assistance to the poor inspired generations of subsequent radicals and reformers. The Age of Reason (1794–1795), Paine’s most controversial work, is an unrestrained assault on the authority of the Bible and a fervent defense of the benevolent God of deism. Included in this volume are a detailed chronology of Paine’s life, informative notes, an essay on the complex printing history of Paine’s work, and an index. LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation’s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America’s best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries.",['Thomas Paine'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2sS8qQBJBaoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2sS8qQBJBaoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Thomas+Paine+:+Collected+Writings+:+Common+Sense+/+The+Crisis+/+Rights+of+Man+/+The+Age+of+Reason+/+Pamphlets,+Articles,+and+Letters+(Library+of+America)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Library of America,1995-03-01,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2sS8qQBJBaoC&dq=Thomas+Paine+:+Collected+Writings+:+Common+Sense+/+The+Crisis+/+Rights+of+Man+/+The+Age+of+Reason+/+Pamphlets,+Articles,+and+Letters+(Library+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api",['History'],8.0

Howard Zinn on History,"Howard Zinn began work on his first book for his friends at Seven Stories Press in 1996, a big volume collecting all his shorter writings organized by subject. The themes he chose reflected his lifelong concerns: war, history, law, class, means and ends, and race. Throughout his life Zinn had returned again and again to these subjects, continually probing and questioning yet rarely reversing his convictions or the vision that informed them. The result was The Zinn Reader. Five years later, starting with Howard Zinn on History, updated editions of sections of that mammoth tome were published in inexpensive stand-alone editions. This second edition of Howard Zinn on History brings together twenty-seven short writings on activism, electoral politics, the Holocaust, Marxism, the Iraq War, and the role of the historian, as well as portraits of Eugene Debs, John Reed, and Jack London, effectively showing how Zinn’s approach to history evolved over nearly half a century, and at the same time sharing his fundamental thinking that social movements—people getting together for peace and social justice—can change the course of history. That core belief never changed. Chosen by Zinn himself as the shorter writings on history he believed to have enduring value—originally appearing in newspapers like the Boston Globe or the New York Times; in magazines like Z, the New Left, the Progressive, or the Nation; or in his book Failure to Quit—these essays appear here as examples of the kind of passionate engagement he believed all historians, and indeed all citizens of whatever profession, need to have, standing in sharp contrast to the notion of ""objective"" or ""neutral"" history espoused by some. ""It is time that we scholars begin to earn our keep in this world,"" he writes in ""The Uses of Scholarship."" And in ""Freedom Schools,"" about his experiences teaching in Mississippi during the remarkable ""Freedom Summer"" of 1964, he adds: ""Education can, and should, be dangerous.""",['Howard Zinn'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iGBOEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=iGBOEAAAQBAJ&dq=Howard+Zinn+on+History&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Seven Stories Press,2011-06-14,http://books.google.nl/books?id=iGBOEAAAQBAJ&dq=Howard+Zinn+on+History&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],
Goal,"Practical Goal Programming is intended to allow academics and practitioners to be able to build effective goal programming models, to detail the current state of the art, and to lay the foundation for its future development and continued application to new and varied fields. Suitable as both a text and reference, its nine chapters first provide a brief history, fundamental definitions, and underlying philosophies, and then detail the goal programming variants and define them algebraically. Chapter 3 details the step-by-step formulation of the basic goal programming model, and Chapter 4 explores more advanced modeling issues and highlights some recently proposed extensions. Chapter 5 then details the solution methodologies of goal programming, concentrating on computerized solution by the Excel Solver and LINGO packages for each of the three main variants, and includes a discussion of the viability of the use of specialized goal programming packages. Chapter 6 discusses the linkages between Pareto Efficiency and goal programming. Chapters 3 to 6 are supported by a set of ten exercises, and an Excel spreadsheet giving the basic solution of each example is available at an accompanying website. Chapter 7 details the current state of the art in terms of the integration of goal programming with other techniques, and the text concludes with two case studies which were chosen to demonstrate the application of goal programming in practice and to illustrate the principles developed in Chapters 1 to 7.

"Pennant race,","From the author of The Long Season—considered by many to be the greatest baseball book of all time—comes another classic sports memoir by legendary pitcher Jim Brosnan, which chronicles how his team, the Cincinnati Reds, went on to win the 1961 National League pennant. With legendary pitcher Jim Brosnan’s first book, The Long Season, he not only entered the canon of great sports literature, but also redefined it when he returned two years later to write Pennant Race—his memoir of his days playing for the Cincinnati Reds and how the team went from not being taken seriously as a pennant contender to having a shot at the 1961 National League pennant. In Pennant Race, Brosnan—with his trademark wise-guy wit and plain-spoken practicality—once again offers a refreshingly candid alternative to hackneyed baseball mythologizing. Day by day, game by game, Brosnan reveals the real lives of professional ballplayers: their exhilaration and frustration, hope and despair, chronic worry over job security, playful camaraderie, world-weary cynicism, and boyish—if cautious—optimism. Although the Reds would ultimately lose the World Series to the Yankees, for Brosnan and his teammates, this was a winning season. Pennant Race vividly captures a remarkable year in the life of a ball club and the golden age of one of Major League Baseball’s most memorable eras. “Brosnan obviously knows his baseball, writes about it wittily, informally and with irony. He is a cynical, tough professional athlete and his book makes wonderful reading.”—New Yorker",['James P.

"The Pony Rider Boys in Alaska; or, The Gold Diggers of Taku Pass","The Pony Rider Boys in Alaska Or, The Gold Diggers of Taku Pass: Large Print By Frank Gee Patchin CHAPTER ITHROUGH ENCHANTING WATERS ""Captain, who are the four silent men leaning over the rail on the other side of the boat?"" asked Tad Butler. ""I have been wondering about them almost ever since we left Vancouver. They don't seem to speak to a person, and seldom to each other, though somehow they appear to be traveling in company. They act as if they were afraid someone would recognize them. I am sure they aren't bad characters."" Captain Petersen, commander of the steamer ""Corsair,"" which for some days had been plowing its way through the ever-changing northern waters, stroked his grizzled beard reflectively. ""Bad characters, eh?"" he twinkled. ""Well, no, I shouldn't say as they were. They're fair-weather lads. I'll vouch for them if necessary, and I guess I'm about the only person on board that knows who they are."" Tad waited expectantly until the skipper came to the point of the story he was telling. ""They are the Gold Diggers of Taku Pass, lad."" ""The Gold Diggers of Taku Pass?"" repeated Tad Butler. ""I don't think I ever heard that name before. Where is this pass, sir?"" The skipper shook his head. ""No one knows,"" he said. ""That is strange,"" wondered Butler. ""Does no one know where they dig for gold?"" ""No. They don't even know themselves,"" was the puzzling reply. Tad fixed the weather-beaten face of the skipper with a questioning gaze. ""I don't think I understand, sir.

Acting Across America,"This book addresses the historical, social, colonial, and administrative contexts that determine today's U.S. actor training, as well as matters of identity politics, access, and marginalization as they emerge in classrooms and rehearsal halls. It considers persistent, questioning voices about our nation’s acting training as it stands, thereby contributing to the national dialogue the diverse perspectives and proposals needed to keep American actor training dynamic and germane, both within the U.S. and abroad. Prominent academics and artists view actor training through a political, cultural or ethical lens, tackling fraught topics about power as it plays out in acting curricula and classrooms. The essays in this volume offer a survey of trends in thinking on actor training and investigate the way American theatre expresses our national identity through the globalization of arts education policy and in the politics of our curriculum decisions.","['Ellen Margolis', 'Lissa Tyler Renaud']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=x2WNAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=x2WNAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA62&dq=Acting+Across+America&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2009-10-31,http://books.google.nl/books?id=x2WNAgAAQBAJ&dq=Acting+Across+America&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Drama'],

Making Books by Hand: A Step-by-Step Guide,"Before the advent of modern mass-production methods, books were bound by hand to remarkably high standards of quality. Beautiful and durable, they appealed to book lovers who appreciated not only a book's content but also the quality and craftsmanship of its binding. Unfortunately, the introduction of machine-binding methods, while making books widely available at reasonable prices, also largely curtailed the art and craft of making fine books by hand. This expert guide offers a solution. In its pages, craftspeople can learn the traditional methods of bookbinding and produce high-quality hand-bound books themselves. Thorough, detailed instructions, with over 270 helpful illustrations by the author, cover materials, tools, and equipment (including making your own); fundamental procedures and technical methods; rebinding an old book; making a slipcase, and other essentials. Also included are well-illustrated, step-by-step directions for eight binding projects: dust jacket; blank book, single signature; folio; blank book, four signatures; manuscript binding; music binding; and two more. Clearly written and easy to follow, this manual will be indispensable to those wishing to create high-quality handcrafted bindings themselves; it will also serve as a valuable reference for students and professionals in publishing and its allied trades.",['Aldren A.

Pla/Cebo,"The placebo effect is a fascinating but elusive phenomena. Although no standard definition of the placebo effect exists, it is generally understood as consisting of responses of individuals to the psychosocial context of medical treatments or clinical encounters, as distinct from specific physiological effects of medical interventions. The Placebo is the first book to compile a selection of classic and contemporary published articles on the topic. Systematic investigation of the placebo effect emerged in the 1950s in response to the development of randomized controlled clinical trials that used “inert” placebo interventions as a pivotal element of scientific evaluation of novel drugs. In recent years, scientific and scholarly investigation of the placebo effect has increased dramatically, reflecting a growing interest in the connection between mind and body with respect to health, the development of brain imaging techniques, dissatisfaction with the reductionist and technological orientation of biomedicine, and growing attention to the use of complementary and alternative medical treatments. The Placebo is organized into three sections: the nature and significance of the placebo effect, experimental studies of the placebo effect, and ethical issues of placebos in research and in clinical practice. This comprehensive sourcebook will be invaluable to investigators and scholars alike.","['Franklin G. Miller', 'Luana Colloca', 'Ted J.

"ASEAN's Diplomatic and Security Culture: Origins, Development and Prospects","Member states of ASEAN - the Association of South-East Asian Nations - have developed a distinctive approach to political and security co-operation, which builds on the principles of sovereign equality, non-intervention and non-interference, quiet diplomacy, mutual respect, and the principle of not involving ASEAN in mediating bilateral disputes among the membership. This book examines the origins of ASEAN's diplomatic and security culture and analyses how over time its key principles have been practised and contested as ASEAN states have responded to regional conflicts as well as challenges posed by the major regional powers, ASEAN's enlargement, and the Asian financial crisis. The book goes on to assess whether ASEAN's diplomatic and security culture is likely to remain salient as the political, economic and security context in which regional leaderships operate is undergoing further change.",['Jurgen Haacke'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=s3WwMjq6VWsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=s3WwMjq6VWsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=ASEAN%27s+Diplomatic+and+Security+Culture:+Origins,+Development+and+Prospects&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Routledge,2013-05-13,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=s3WwMjq6VWsC&dq=ASEAN%27s+Diplomatic+and+Security+Culture:+Origins,+Development+and+Prospects&hl=&source=gbs_api",['History'],
The Handsome road,"A saga of Louisiana by an author who “belongs among those Southern novelists who are trying to interpret the South and its past in critical terms” (The New York Times). Published in the late 1930s by New York Times–bestselling author Gwen Bristow, the Plantation Trilogy is an epic series of novels that bring to life the history of Louisiana—from its settlement in the late eighteenth century to the realities of slavery and poverty to the post–World War I era—via the intertwined lives of the members of three families: the Sheramys, the Larnes, and the Upjohns. Deep Summer is the story of Puritan pioneer Judith Sheramy and adventurer Philip Larne, who marry and strive to build an empire in the Louisiana wilderness during the American Revolution. The Handsome Road tells the story of plantation mistress Ann Sheramy Larne and poor seamstress Corrie May Upjohn, who forge an unlikely bond of friendship as they struggle to survive the cataclysms of the Civil War and Reconstruction. This Side of Glory presents the story of Eleanor Upjohn, a modern young woman in the early twentieth century who marries charming Kester Larne and struggles to save the debt-ridden plantation that her husband’s ancestors founded more than one hundred years ago.",['Gwen Bristow'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hvycBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=hvycBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Handsome+road&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Open Road Media,2015-05-12,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hvycBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],2.0
The Organic Codes: An Introduction to Semantic Biology,"The genetic code appeared on Earth with the first cells. The codes of cultural evolution arrived almost four billion years later. These are the only codes that are recognized by modern biology. In this book, however, Marcello Barbieri explains that there are many more organic codes in nature, and their appearance not only took place throughout the history of life but marked the major steps of that history. A code establishes a correspondence between two independent worlds , and the codemaker is a third party between those worlds . Therefore the cell can be thought of as a trinity of genotype, phenotype and ribotype. The ancestral ribotypes were the agents which gave rise to the first cells. The book goes on to explain how organic codes and organic memories can be used to shed new light on the problems encountered in cell signalling, epigenesis, embryonic development, and the evolution of language.",['Marcello Barbieri'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cvskkoD7rx0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=cvskkoD7rx0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Organic+Codes:+An+Introduction+to+Semantic+Biology&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Cambridge University Press,2003,http://books.google.nl/books?id=cvskkoD7rx0C&dq=The+Organic+Codes:+An+Introduction+to+Semantic+Biology&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Medical'],

While the general structure of the book remains unchanged, some notable changes have been made to improve the clarity and readability of basic material about differential equations and their applications.

"Women Creating Lives: Identities, Resilience, And Resistance","There is no other published book in English studying the constitution of the Roman Republic as a whole. Yet the Greek historian Polybius believed that the constitution was a fundamental cause of the exponential growth of Rome's empire. He regarded the Republic as unusual in two respects: first, because it functioned so well despite being a mix of monarchy, oligarchy and democracy; secondly, because the constitution was the product of natural evolution rather than the ideals of a lawgiver.Even if historians now seek more widely for the causes of Rome's rise to power, the importance and influence of her political institutions remains. The reasons for Rome's power are both complex, on account of the mix of elements, and flexible, inasmuch as they were not founded on written statutes but on unwritten traditions reinterpreted by successive generations. Knowledge of Rome's political institutions is essential both for ancient historians and for those who study the contribution of Rome to the republican tradition of political thought from the Middle Ages to the revolutions inspired by the Enlightenment.",['Abby J Stewart'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_Dq0AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_Dq0AAAAIAAJ&q=Women+Creating+Lives:+Identities,+Resilience,+And+Resistance&dq=Women+Creating+Lives:+Identities,+Resilience,+And+Resistance&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Westview Press,1994-06-15,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_Dq0AAAAIAAJ&dq=Women+Creating+Lives:+Identities,+Resilience,+And+Resistance&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Social Science'],
Emotional Honesty & Self-Acceptance,"There is no excuse for not teaching preventive, healthy coping strategies to prepare kids for their teenage years. -- Ronald R. Brill In his innovative book, Emotional Honesty & Self-Acceptance, Ronald Brill, a former university professor and health educator, argues that youth can learn how to self-manage upsetting and stressful experiences. This work explains the relationship between recognizing and dealing with emotional pain, which is essential to avoid harmful behavior toward ones self and others. Since the book was published in 2000 he continues to research and develop training programs for educators, including advising schools and student services professionals so they can more effectively help students learn and practice brain-based coping skills to reduce thigh risk emotional stress. This book contains guiding principles used in classroom programs he introduced to over 700 4th to 6th grade elementary students from 2002 to 2008. His virtual classroom website, www.copingskills4kids.net, helps schools, parents and counselors guide children in the use of healthy and safe coping skills. The book and website are designed to enable recovery from everyday emotional pain caused by loss, rejection, betrayal and humiliation. He refers to these as universal, core Emotionally Wounding Experiences. Like physical wounds, emotional ones can also be infected if left unattended or ignored. His classroom programs prove that by age of nine, students can learn these lessons to begin preparing for the turbulent teenage years. Violence prevention is an important benefit of developing emotional resilience and self-acceptance. The authors commitment to brain-based coping skills learning is now shared by tens of thousands of individuals and institutions around the world seeking new ways to help youth avoid harming others for the emotionally wounds they may otherwise have not learned to heal. The 300-page book uses analysis of school shooting incidents to advocate new strategies schools and parents can use to boost kids coping confidence needed to more easily get over inevitable emotionally painful and stressful experiences. It is written for mature teenagers and adults. This powerful tool provides evidence to those advocating coping skills education programs at home and school. This approach with todays youth can make them more responsible and self-accepting persons. It also helps them develop new capabilities to deal with the emotional challenges and changes during adolescence. Some Introductory Chapter Titles: What We Dont Know About Hurt Feelings Can Kill Us!

Sweet Dream Baby,"Sent to live in the humidity of rural Florida with his grandparents and his sixteen-year-old Aunt Delia for the summer, twelve-year-old Travis becomes absorbed in the closed ways of small-town life. Captivated by Delia, Travis watches her attempt to find a place for herself in the socially stunted, gossip-driven town. Delia's secrets go beyond what Travis can understand, but he believes that he alone can save her--a belief that not only forces him to grow up fast, but one that builds to a dangerous and disturbing climax. In trying to free Delia from her past, Travis leads her into a shocking present and a most uncertain future. In a work at once honest, chilling and compulsively addictive, author Sterling Watson has created a time and place where rock 'n' roll hums from AM radios, steam rises from a secluded riverbed and violent summer storms threaten the peace of silent nights. Watson's characters are brought vividly to life through Travis's touching, powerful and intensely personal voice. A dark and evocative coming of age tale, Sweet Dream Baby begins steeped in innocence and ends in a dramatically different place. ""I can't remember a book that sneaked up and grabbed me the way Sweet Dream Baby did. It's a real shocker by a very good writer."" --Elmore Leonard ""Sterling Watson's Sweet Dream Baby is one of the finest novels I've read in years, an incandescent blend of gothic noir, Faulknerian dreamscape and bittersweet coming-of-age story.

Enterprise Resources Planning and Beyond: Integrating Your Entire Organization (Resource Management),"To achieve success in today's business climate you must do more than provide high quality low cost products to customers when and how they want them. Customers and suppliers require fully integrated information - throughout the supply chain or value chain. You must integrate your organization so completely that executive decisions are implemented effortlessly. Competitive pressures often cause a reduction in prices, in spite of continually rising costs. A decrease in prices paired with increased costs quickly eliminates any profitability and threatens your company's ability to survive. This book shows you how you can reduce costs through the elimination of waste caused by poor communication and coordination throughout a company as well as between the company, its suppliers, and its customers. The author explains Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) in non-technical terms, describing how an ERP system can fully integrate all functions in your manufacturing organization. He demonstrates the system's capability to increase efficiency and profitability - and to delight the customer - as well as its current deficiencies. In addition to his thorough coverage of ERP, the author introduces Total Enterprise Integration (TEI), the process of integrating all the information required to fully support a manufacturing company. TEI represents a logical extension of complete information integration throughout a manufacturing enterprise and into the supply chain. This new concept shows you how the intelligent use of work flow allows responsibility to go to the most appropriate front-line decision makers while maintaining proper budgetary and operational controls. The power of TEI is in the integration of communication across the entire manufacturing company, and out through the supply chain to customers and suppliers. Enterprise Resource Planning and Beyond: Integrating Your Entire Organization focuses on what a fully integrated system can do for you.

The California Heritage Cookbook,"Food - its cultivation, preparation and communal consumption - has long been considered a form of cultural heritage. A dynamic, living product, food creates social bonds as it simultaneously marks off and maintains cultural difference. In bringing together anthropologists, historians and other scholars of food and heritage, this volume closely examines the ways in which the cultivation, preparation, and consumption of food is used to create identity claims of 'cultural heritage' on local, regional, national and international scales. Contributors explore a range of themes, including how food is used to mark insiders and outsiders within an ethnic group; how the same food's meanings change within a particular society based on class, gender or taste; and how traditions are 'invented' for the revitalization of a community during periods of cultural pressure. Featuring case studies from Europe, Asia and the Americas, this timely volume also addresses the complex processes of classifying, designating, and valorizing food as 'terroir,' 'slow food,' or as intangible cultural heritage through UNESCO. By effectively analyzing food and foodways through the perspectives of critical heritage studies, this collection productively brings two overlapping but frequently separate theoretical frameworks into conversation.","['Ronda L.

Advertising and a Democratic Press,"In this provocative book, C. Edwin Baker argues that print advertising seriously distorts the flow of news by creating a powerfully corrupting incentive: the more newspapers depend financially on advertising, the more they favor the interests of advertisers over those of readers. Advertising induces newspapers to compete for a maximum audience with blandly ""objective"" information, resulting in reduced differentiation among papers and the eventual collapse of competition among dailies. Originally published in 1994. The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions.

At The Feet Of The Master,"The privilege is given to me, as an elder, to pen a word of introduction to this little book, the first written by a younger Brother, young in body verily, but not in Soul. The teachings contained in it were given to him by his Master in preparing him for Initiation, and were written down by him from memory - slowly and laboriously, for his English last year was far less fluent than it is now. The greater part is a reproduction of the Master's own words; that which is not such a verbal reproduction is the Master's thought clothed in His pupil's words. Two omitted sentences were supplied by the Master. In two other cases an omitted word has been added. Beyond this, it is entirely Alcyone's own, his first gift to the world. May it help others as the spoken teachings helped him - such is the hope with which he gives it. But the teaching can only be fruitful if it is lived, as he has lived it, since it fell from the Master's lips.

White Rock Ways,"Enjoy free will, but prepare for destiny. Welcome to Book 2 of Rae Crossmon's White Rock Series. Familiar faces. New players. Ancient conflicts. Fresh battles. One overriding sentiment: Free will is a terrible thing. But it’s better than the alternative. Jessica McConsas is in love with three men. Perhaps one is evil. Perhaps one is good. Perhaps one is just a catalyst. But it's never that easy when it comes to White Rock. While campaigning for her father, Jessica becomes involved with Piers, a reclusive and mysterious young man. She also finds an unlikely ally in an old friend, Vance Munroe Easton, who helps her discover the truth behind a dark family mystery. Last but not least, Jess struggles to forget Evan Helmsley and their night in the snowstorm, something much easier said than done. On the other side of the country, Evan learns how to be a friend, with the help of an extraordinary woman. Sondra has her own secrets, but she doesn't share them until it's too late. Her decisions offer Evan a chance to redeem himself by taking responsibility for another child—maybe doing it right this time. Evan’s sister Henri has to decide how much she believes in old legends, while her lover Byrne finds he is still capable of being surprised. When Henri finally meets the daughter she gave away, an old dream collides harshly with reality. A new family joins the fray. When Anderson Annolla conceives a young child from a vacation tryst, she becomes caught in an old war between Jackson, the father of her son, and Jarenth, his half-brother. Andy must ally with Jarenth to save Heath, while protecting a dark secret from her own past. Jack’s resentment and jealousy fuel a decision to hurt Andy with an action that has tragic consequences for all involved. Rae Crossmon's ""twisted fairy tales"" highlight an ancient Slavic legend wrapped in modern suspense stories. Each book builds toward a final conflict between ancient enemies while exploring themes such as free will vs. fate, family secrets, and the status of myth in contemporary American society.",['Rae Crossmon'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0PBaCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=0PBaCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT167&dq=White+Rock+Ways&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Rae Crossmon,2013-09-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0PBaCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],
"Collected Poems, 1920-1954: Revised Bilingual Edition","A strong, idiomatic translation of Italy's greatest modern poet. Eugenio Montale is universally recognized as having brought the great Italian lyric tradition that began with Dante into the twentieth century with unrivaled power and brilliance. Montale is a love poet whose deeply beautiful, individual work confronts the dilemmas of modern history, philosophy, and faith with courage and subtlety; he has been widely translated into English and his work has influenced two generations of American and British poets. Jonathan Galassi's versions of Montale's major works--Ossi di seppia, Le occasioni, and La bufera e altro--are the clearest and most convincing yet, and his extensive notes discuss in depth the sources and difficulties of this dense, allusive poetry.

Comici spaventati guerrieri: Romanzo (I Narratori/Feltrinelli) (Italian Edition),"‘Levi is een humanist, die in staat was gebleken onder de allerergste omstandigheden zijn waardigheid te behouden.’ NRC Handelsblad De Joods-Italiaanse verzetsstrijder Primo Levi trok in 1943 de bergen in, maar hij werd al na enkele maanden gepakt en naar Auschwitz gedeporteerd. Als een van de weinigen overleefde hij die hel en keerde hij terug en schreef, aanvankelijk uit een chaotische, blinde drang, Is dit een mens. In dit boek beschrijft hij in heldere taal en nuchter het leven in het kamp, de angst, de honger, de pijn, de ontberingen, de verschrikkingen. Het wordt terecht als een van de klassieke getuigenissen over de Jodenvervolging beschouwd. In de pers ‘Wat Primo Levi kon, was de afgrijselijkste en grootste misdaad in de moderne geschiedenis, de Holocaust, van binnenuit zo beschrijven, dat hij recht doet aan de complexiteit ervan.

The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft,"'a brilliant history' The Sunday Times 'makes for riveting reading' The Independent Modern pagan witchcraft is arguably the only fully-formed religion England has given the world, and has now spread across four continents. This second edition of The Triumph of the Moon extensively revises the first full-scale scholarly study of modern pagan witchcraft. Ronald Hutton examines the nature and development of this religion, and offers a history of attitudes to witchcraft, paganism and magic in British society since 1800. Its pages reveal village cunning folk, Victorian ritual magicians, classicists and archaeologists, leaders of woodcraft and scouting movements, Freemasons, and members of rural secret societies. We also find some of the leading figures of English literature, from the Romantic poets to W. B. Yeats, D. H. Lawrence and Robert Graves, as well as the main personalities who have represented pagan witchcraft to the public world since 1950. Thriller writers like Dennis Wheatley, and films and television programmes, get similar coverage, as does tabloid journalism. The material is by its nature often sensational, and care is taken throughout to distinguish fact from fantasy, in a manner not previously applied to most of the stories involved. Meticulously researched, The Triumph of the Moon presents an authoritative insight into an aspect of modern cultural history which has attracted sensational publicity but has hitherto been little understood. This edition incorporates new research carried out by the author as well as research by others who have been inspired by this book over the twenty years since its first publication.",['Ronald Hutton'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=25OzDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=25OzDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Triumph+of+the+Moon:+A+History+of+Modern+Pagan+Witchcraft&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Oxford University Press,2019-10-10,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=25OzDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']",6.0

Steam: The Untold Story Of America's First Great Invention,"In 1807, Robert Fulton, using an English mail-order steam engine, chugged four miles an hour up the Hudson River, passing into popular folklore as the inventor of the steamboat. However, the true first passenger steamboat in America, and the world, was built from scratch, and plied the Delaware River in 1790, almost two decades earlier. Its inventor, John Fitch, never attained Fulton's riches, and was rewarded with ridicule and poverty. Considering there was not a single working steam engine in America in the early 1780s, Fitch's steamboat's development was nothing short of remarkable. But he faced competition from the start, and he and several other inventors fought a string of bitter battles, legal and otherwise. Steam tells the dramatic story of Fitch and his adversaries, weaving their lives into a fascinating tale including the likes of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin. It is the story behind America's first important venture in technology, the persevering and colorful men that made it happen, and the great invention that moved a new nation westward.",['Andrea Sutcliffe'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0hJ4BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=0hJ4BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Steam:+The+Untold+Story+Of+America%27s+First+Great+Invention&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,St. Martin's Press,2015-03-24,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0hJ4BgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],

"Labor's untold story,","""Fundamentally, labor's story is the story of the American people. To view it narrowly, to concentrate on the history of specific trade unions or on the careers of individuals and their rivalries, would be to miss the point that the great forces which have swept the American people into action have been the very forces that have also molded labor. Trade unionism was born as an effective national movement amid the great convulsion of the Civil War and the fight for black freedom... Labor suffered under depressions which spurred the whole American people into movement in the seventies, in the eighties, and in the nineties. It reached its greatest heights when it joined hands with farmers, small businessmen, and the black people in the epic Populist revolts of the 1890's and later in the triumph that was the New Deal. For labor has never lived in isolation or progressed without allies. Always it has been in the main stream of American life,... Labor's story, by its very nature, is synchronized at every turn with the growth and development of American monopoly. Its great leap forward into industrial unionism was an answering action to the development of trusts and great industrial empires. Labor's grievances, in fact the very conditions of its life, have been imposed by its great antagonist, that combination of industrial and financial power often known as Wall Street. The mind and actions of William H. Sylvis, the iron molder who founded the first effective national labor organization, can scarcely be understood without also an understanding of the genius and cunning of his contemporary, John D. Rockefeller, father of the modern trust. In the long view of history the machinations of J. P. Morgan, merging banking and industrial capital as he threw together ever larger combinations of corporate power controlled by fewer and fewer men, may have governed the course of American labor more than the plans of Samuel Gompers."" -- Amazon.com viewed January 11, 2021.","['Richard Boyer', 'Richard Owen Boyer', 'Herbert Montfort Morais']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UV7tAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UV7tAAAAMAAJ&q=Labor%27s+untold+story,&dq=Labor%27s+untold+story,&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",United Electrical Radio &,1975,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UV7tAAAAMAAJ&dq=Labor%27s+untold+story,&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Business & Economics'],2.0

Lanterns: A Memoir of Mentors,"I am grateful beyond words for the example of the lanterns shared in this memoir whose lives I hope will illuminate my children's, your children's, and the paths of countless others coming behind.--Marian Wright Edelman, from the Preface Marian Wright Edelman, ""the most influential children's advocate in the country"" (The Washington Post), shares stories from her life at the center of this century's most dramatic civil rights struggles. She pays tribute to the extraordinary personal mentors who helped light her way: Martin Luther King, Jr., Robert F. Kennedy, Fannie Lou Hamer, William Sloane Coffin, Ella Baker, Mae Bertha Carter, and many others. She celebrates the lives of the great Black women of Bennettsville, South Carolina-Miz Tee, Miz Lucy, Miz Kate-who along with her parents formed a formidable and loving network of community support for the young Marian Wright as a Black girl growing up in the segregated South. We follow the author to Spelman College in the late 1950s, when the school was a hotbed of civil rights activism, and where, through excerpts from her honest and passionate college journal, we witness a national leader in the making and meet the people who inspired and empowered her, including Dr. Benjamin E. Mays, Howard Zinn, and Charles E. Merrill, Jr. Lanterns takes us to Mississippi in the 1960s, where Edelman was the first and only Black woman lawyer. Her account of those years is a riveting first-hand addition to the literature of civil rights: ""The only person I recognized in the menacing crowd as I walked towards the front courthouse steps was [a] veteran New York Times reporter. He neither acknowledged me nor met my eyes. I knew then what it was like to be a poor Black person in Mississippi: alone."" And we follow Edelman as she leads Bobby Kennedy on his fateful trip to see Mississippi poverty and hunger for himself, a powerful personal experience for the young RFK that helped awaken a nation's conscience to child hunger and poverty.

Mothman Prophecies,"This true account of the aliens who invaded the town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia - first published in 1975 - has been made into a major motion picture starring Richard Gere, Laura Linney and Alan Bates. For thirteen months Point Pleasant was plagued by a dark terror that culminated in a major disaster. Unearthly noises and ghostly lights in the sky gave way to mutilated animals, winged monsters, weird flying machines and worst of all, the fearsomely demonic 'Bird' - the Mothman.

"The Devil in Silicon Valley: Northern California, Race, and Mexican Americans","This sweeping history explores the growing Latino presence in the United States over the past two hundred years. It also debunks common myths about Silicon Valley, one of the world's most influential but least-understood places. Far more than any label of the moment, the devil of racism has long been Silicon Valley's defining force, and Stephen Pitti argues that ethnic Mexicans--rather than computer programmers--should take center stage in any contemporary discussion of the ""new West."" Pitti weaves together the experiences of disparate residents--early Spanish-Mexican settlers, Gold Rush miners, farmworkers transplanted from Texas, Chicano movement activists, and late-twentieth-century musicians--to offer a broad reevaluation of the American West. Based on dozens of oral histories as well as unprecedented archival research, The Devil in Silicon Valley shows how San José, Santa Clara, and other northern California locales played a critical role in the ongoing development of Latino politics. This is a transnational history. In addition to considering the past efforts of immigrant and U.S.-born miners, fruit cannery workers, and janitors at high-tech firms--many of whom retained strong ties to Mexico--Pitti describes the work of such well-known Valley residents as César Chavez. He also chronicles the violent opposition ethnic Mexicans have faced in Santa Clara Valley. In the process, he reinterprets not only California history but the Latino political tradition and the story of American labor. This book follows California race relations from the Franciscan missions to the Gold Rush, from the New Almaden mine standoff to the Apple janitorial strike. As the first sustained account of Northern California's Mexican American history, it challenges conventional thinking and tells a fascinating story. Bringing the past to bear on the present, The Devil in Silicon Valley is counter-history at its best.",['Stephen J.

The Gods of Mars,"The Barsoom series continues: John Carter returns to Mars to face a deadly race of alien gods in this classic space adventure. When Civil War veteran John Carter was mysteriously transported to Mars—known by its inhabitants as Barsoom—he found love with Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium, and a home closer to his heart than any he knew on Earth. After being sent unwillingly back to his native planet, Carter is finally making his return to Barsoom. But instead of arriving at the land of Helium, he finds himself a world away from his Martian love—in the Valley of Dor. Controlled by the Therns, an alien race of self-proclaimed gods, the Valley of Dor is a dangerous realm from which no one has ever returned. There, Carter reunites with his Martian friend Tars Tarkas, and together they mount a daring escape. But when Carter finally makes it to Helium, he will discover his adventure has only just begun, as Dejah has ventured into the Valley of Dor to find him . . .",['Edgar Rice Burroughs'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t9PVDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=t9PVDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Gods+of+Mars&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Open Road Media,2020-03-17,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t9PVDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],26.0

"Compact Heat Exchangers: Selection, Design and Operation","This book presents the ideas and industrial concepts in compact heat exchanger technology that have been developed in the last 10 years or so. Historically, the development and application of compact heat exchangers and their surfaces has taken place in a piecemeal fashion in a number of rather unrelated areas, principally those of the automotive and prime mover, aerospace, cryogenic and refrigeration sectors. Much detailed technology, familiar in one sector, progressed only slowly over the boundary into another sector. This compartmentalisation was a feature both of the user industries themselves, and also of the supplier, or manufacturing industries. These barriers are now breaking down, with valuable cross-fertilisation taking place. One of the industrial sectors that is waking up to the challenges of compact heat exchangers is that broadly defined as the process sector. If there is a bias in the book, it is towards this sector. Here, in many cases, the technical challenges are severe, since high pressures and temperatures are often involved, and working fluids can be corrosive, reactive or toxic. The opportunities, however, are correspondingly high, since compacts can offer a combination of lower capital or installed cost, lower temperature differences (and hence running costs), and lower inventory. In some cases they give the opportunity for a radical re-think of the process design, by the introduction of process intensification (PI) concepts such as combining process elements in one unit. An example of this is reaction and heat exchange, which offers, among other advantages, significantly lower by-product production. To stimulate future research, the author includes coverage of hitherto neglected approaches, such as that of the Second Law (of Thermodynamics), pioneered by Bejan and co- workers. The justification for this is that there is increasing interest in life-cycle and sustainable approaches to industrial activity as a whole, often involving exergy (Second Law) analysis. Heat exchangers, being fundamental components of energy and process systems, are both savers and spenders of exergy, according to interpretation.",['John E.

Beauty & Submission,"""This book is as seductive as the phenomenon that it explores. With courage, love, and joy, Frueh crosses into unexplored terrains of beauty and pleasure, where she finds a grotesquely captivating creature: Monster/Beauty. By illuminating her journey with thoughtful insight and engaging prose, she encourages readers to join her in her quest to articulate fresh ways of thinking about the aesthetic and the erotic and of theorizing the flux of lived experience."" —John Alan Farmer, senior editor of Art Journal ""Monster/Beauty is a daringly provocative experiment in personal and erotic writing and an important book for anyone interested in breaking normative codes of beauty, pedagogy, and authorial methodology. In a richly self-revealing text, Frueh proposes nothing less than a Rabellaisian re-ordering of aesthetic embodiments within social relations."" —Mira Schor, author of Wet: On Painting, Feminism, and Art Culture ""Giving new meaning to ""embodied writing,"" this book goes farther than any other toward getting the body into the text. Joanna Frueh is a performance artist first-she is also an art historian, a singer, a poet, a bodybuilder, a professor, an academic celebrity of modest fame, but her performances collapse these distinctions. Frueh's intensely personal, intensely physical prose brings an aura of presence to the book that rivals the effect she achieves on stage."" —Robyn Warhol, co-editor of Feminisms ""This book is monstrous--full of gorgeous hypermuscular women, step-mothers, and vampires; full of ravishing muscular sex, classroom erotics, splendid aging. It is a performance in which Frueh explores and celebrates her body, its powers and beauties, and those of her friends and lovers."" —Alphonso Lingis, author of Excesses, Abuses, and Dangerous Emotions ""A welcome voice in contemporary feminist theory, Frueh's Monster/Beauty reminds us of the pleasures of thinking, teaching and creating in wholly embodied, sensual and passionate acts.

Man Who Planted Trees,"‘A book for children from 8 to 80. I love the humanity of this story and how one man’s efforts can change the future for so many. It’s a real message of hope.’ Michael Morpurgo Discover this beloved masterpiece of nature writing that is a hymn to creation and to the power of the individual to do their bit to change the world for the better. In 1910, while hiking through the wild lavender in a wind-swept, desolate valley in Provence, a man comes across a shepherd called Elzéard Bouffier. Staying with him, he watches Elzéard sorting and then planting hundreds of acorns as he walks through the wilderness. Ten years later, after surviving the First World War, he visits the shepherd again and sees the young forest he has created spreading slowly over the valley. Elzéard’s solitary, silent work continues and the narrator returns year after year to see the miracle he is gradually creating: a verdant, green landscape that is a testament to one man’s creative instinct. A beautiful story of hope, survival and selflessness, The Man Who Planted Trees resonates as strongly with readers today as when it was first published.",['Jean Giono'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xHwyBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=xHwyBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Man+Who+Planted+Trees&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Random House,2015-01-29,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xHwyBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],8.0
Howard Zinn on War,"This second edition of Howard Zinn on War is a collection of twenty-six short writings chosen by the author to represent his thinking on a subject that concerned and fascinated him throughout his career. He reflects on the wars against Iraq, the war in Kosovo, the Vietnam War, World War II, and on the meaning of war generally in a world of nations that can't seem to stop destroying each other. These readings appeared first in magazines and newspapers including the Progressive and the Boston Globe, as well as in Zinn's books, Failure to Quit, Vietnam: The Logic of Withdrawal, The Politics of History, and Declarations of Independence. Here we see Zinn's perspective as a World War II veteran and peace activist who lived through the most devastating wars of the twentieth century and questioned every one of them with his combination of integrity and historical acumen. In his essay, ""Just and Unjust War,"" Zinn challenges us to fight for justice ""with struggle, but without war."" He writes in ""After the War"" (2006) that while governments bring us into war, ""their power is dependent on the obedience of the citizenry. When that is withdrawn, governments are helpless."" In Howard Zinn on War, his message is clear: ""The abolition of war has become not only desirable but absolutely necessary if the planet is to be saved. It is an idea whose time has come.""",['Howard Zinn'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jmBOEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=jmBOEAAAQBAJ&dq=Howard+Zinn+on+War&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Seven Stories Press,2011-06-14,http://books.google.nl/books?id=jmBOEAAAQBAJ&dq=Howard+Zinn+on+War&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],

Just Business: New Introductory Essays in Business Ethics,"faces the urgent problem of determining what political and social conditions must be preserved in order to ensure a continu. ing thriving economy. ""2 And the ethicist, we may add, can draw on all of those problems and quite a few more characteristic of situations when traditional communities struggle with the impact of sudden and unprecedented wealth as well as with a technological transformation of their society of singular proportions. Hong Kong is truly a society in transition, a society whose time is running short and which therefore cannot afford to wait long before it has to make decisive choices, choices also in ethics. The time factor which is so infamous in various ethical dilemmas applies here to the society as a whole; it may also account for some of its not just morally significant shortcomings. II. Ethics in a Cross-cultural Perspective The authors of this volume are scholars and researchers based in Hong 3 Kong who have been living and working in the territory for many years. They are not only representative of the increased research interest in ethical issues across the academic spectrum of Hong Kong universities, but also of the inter disciplinary approach which has become the hallmark of work in applied eth ics. As is well documented, ethics research, at long last, has left behind its disciplinary confines and, even more so, the philosophical ivory tower and begun to permeate the full scope of the academic and scientific agenda.",['Gerhold K.

In additon to analyzing Carter's successes and failures as president, Rutland also examines the forces that went into the Democratic defeats and Republican victories in 1980, 1984, and 1988, concluding with the election of another Jeffersonian Democrat, William Jefferson Clinton.

Numerous exercises (and suggested answers) are provided at every stage.

Leopardi: A Study in Solitude,"An extremely moving account of the lonely life of the unloved and tragic genius - described as ""the greatest modern Italian poet"" 'Love me, by God; I need love, love, love, fire, enthusiasm, life. The world does not seem made for me' Giacomo Leopardi, considered the greatest Italian poet since Dante, was one of the most radical thinkers of the nineteenth century. He also regarded himself one of the most miserable and unfortunate people to have lived. Born to strict parents in a provincial town in 1798, he had a lonely childhood, and he spent his time largely in his father's library. He suffered from a debilitating illness, and his short life was full of pain. But this pain and misery gave rise to some of the most intense and brilliant poems ever written in the Italian language. In this poetic biography, Iris Origo, author of the bestselling War in Val d'Orcia traces the short and lonely life of this conflicted poet. Written with generosity and understanding, A Study in Solitude is a sharp, moving portrait of a frail and frustrated genius. Iris Origo (1902-1988) was a British-born biographer and writer. She lived in Italy and devoted much of her life to the improvement of the Tuscan estate at La Foce, which she purchased with her husband in the 1920s. During WWII, she sheltered refugee children and assisted many escaped Allied prisoners of war and partisans in defiance of Italy's fascist regime and Nazi occupation forces. Pushkin Press also publishes her war diaries, War in Val d'Orcia, her memoir, Images and Shadows, as well as another of her biographies, The Last Attachment.",['Iris Origo'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7jHZDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=7jHZDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Leopardi:+A+Study+in+Solitude&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Pushkin Press,2017-06-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7jHZDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],
The Forsythe Saga,"The Forsyte Saga was the title originally destined for that part of it which is called The Man of Property; and to adopt it for the collected chronicles of the Forsyte family has indulged the Forsytean tenacity that is in all of us. The word Saga might be objected to on the ground that it connotes the heroic and that there is little heroism in these pages. But it is used with a suitable irony; and, after all, this long tale, though it may deal with folk in frock coats, furbelows, and a gilt-edged period, is not devoid of the essential heat of conflict. Discounting for the gigantic stature and blood-thirstiness of old days, as they have come down to us in fairy-tale and legend, the folk of the old Sagas were Forsytes, assuredly, in their possessive instincts, and as little proof against the inroads of beauty and passion as Swithin, Soames, or even Young Jolyon. And if heroic figures, in days that never were, seem to startle out from their surroundings in fashion unbecoming to a Forsyte of the Victorian era, we may be sure that tribal instinct was even then the prime force, and that family and the sense of home and property counted as they do to this day, for all the recent efforts to talk them out.",['John Galsworthy'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ChUxEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=ChUxEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Forsythe+Saga&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,FilRougeViceversa,2021-08-27,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ChUxEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],20.0

In Athena's Camp: Preparing for Conflict in the Information Age,"The information revolution--which is as much an organizational as a technological revolution--is transforming the nature of conflict across the spectrum: from open warfare, to terrorism, crime, and even radical social activism. The era of massed field armies is passing, because the new information and communications systems are increasing the lethality of quite small units that can call in deadly, precise missile fire almost anywhere, anytime. In social conflicts, the Internet and other media are greatly empowering individuals and small groups to influence the behavior of states. Whether in military or social conflicts, all protagonists will soon be developing new doctrines, strategies, and tactics for swarming their opponents--with weapons or words, as circumstances require. Preparing for conflict in such a world will require shifting to new forms of organization, particularly the versatile, hardy, all-channel network. This shift will prove difficult for states and professional militaries that remain bastions of hierarchy, bound to resist institutional redesign. They will make the shift as they realize that information and knowledge are becoming the key elements of power. This implies, among other things, that Mars, the old brute-force god of war, must give way to Athena, the well-armed goddess of wisdom. Accepting Athena as the patroness of this information age represents a first step not only for preparing for future conflicts, but also for preventing them.","['John Arquilla', 'David Ronfeldt']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qJGawYmm6b4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=qJGawYmm6b4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=In+Athena%27s+Camp:+Preparing+for+Conflict+in+the+Information+Age&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Rand Corporation,1997-10-07,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qJGawYmm6b4C&source=gbs_api,['Computers'],1.0
Indian villages and place names in Pennsylvania,"No state in the entire Nation is richer in Indian names, or in fact, in Indian history than Pennsylvania. These Indian names of Pennsylvania are full of music, but, of far greater importance, they are full of history. A History of the Indian Villages and Place Names in Pennsylvania, which was first published in 1928, is the only major book of the 20th century that traces Pennsylvania’s Indian place and names for their correct form, origin and history. Its pages are filled with the most incredible collection of information ever assembled on the Indian villages of Pennsylvania and their Indian place names and is an Indian history scholar’s delight. In preparing his book, Dr. Donehoo researched every available source of printed material about Indian place names in Pennsylvania. He also walked nearly every Indian trail, from the Delaware to the Ohio, using early trader’s journals and maps as his guide, to seek out the places the Indians lived. Each Indian name comes complete with historical notes by the author. The book includes a list of all the sources used to authenticate each Indian place name. An excellent bibliography follows at the conclusion of the work along with appendixes listing: the Indian villages of New York destroyed by General Sullivan’s army in 1779, prehistoric works in Pennsylvania by county, and an alphabetical listing of all Indian named places in each county.",['George P.

"Combined Operations: The Official Story of the Commandos, with a Foreword by Vice-Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten.","This is an astonishing, absolutely absorbing account of the accomplishments of those picked men from the Royal Navy, the British Army, and the Royal Air Force, who work with U.S. Rangers and others of the United Nations in what is known officially as Combined Operations—or, more popularly, the Commandos. So far as possible, without giving aid to the enemy, it is the complete story of the Commandos since the very beginning of their activities, commencing with the experimental attacks on Norwegian islands, and proceeding with more ambitious attempts on the Continent. In quick succession follow highly dramatic accounts of the assault on southern Italy, the evacuation of Crete, the defeat of the French in Syria, the daring penetration of the enemy’s line in Libya—culminating in the suspenseful stalking of Rommel’s headquarters—the assault on St. Nazaire, the capture of Madagascar, the Dieppe raid, the invasion of North Africa. The book is utterly without heroics, and yet is all heroism. The reader marvels at the terrible efficiency, the terrible simplicity, the terrible courage and the awesome nonchalance of the British Royal Navy and Army and R.A.F. men who participate in these raids. The author has the true narrator’s gift—a style which is direct, authentic, episodic in a high degree, and stirring from beginning to end.

Tales of Soldiers and Civilians,"The stories featured in this collection detail the lives of soldiers and civilians during the American Civil War. Bierce served as a union soldier during the Civil War and his experiences as a soldier served as an inspiration for his writing, particularly for the Soldiers section. In this way, Bierce's anticipates and parallels the work of Ernest Hemingway's, just as his civilian tales later influenced horror writers. Ambrose Bierce (1842-1914) was an American writer, journalist, critic, poet, and Civil War veteran, best known for The Devil's Dictionary (1911). He dominated the horror genre as the preeminent innovator of supernatural storytelling in the period between the death of Edgar Allan Poe and the rise of H.P. Lovecraft. Bierce’s death was as mysterious as his strange stories; sometime around 1914 he left for Mexico, wanting to experience the Mexican Revolution firsthand, and was never to be seen again.",['Ambrose Bierce'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GtRzEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=GtRzEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Tales+of+Soldiers+and+Civilians&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Lindhardt og Ringhof,2022-06-21,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GtRzEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],

Swan,"Laat je verrassen door New York Times-bestsellerauteur Frances Mayes in haar eerste roman ‘Het geheim van Swan’. Mayes is vooral bekend van haar idyllische boeken over het Toscaanse leven, zoals ‘Een huis in Toscane’ en ‘Bella Toscane’. In haar meeslepende debuutroman krijgt archeoloog Ginger Mason een telefoontje dat haar leven voorgoed verandert. Het lichaam van haar overleden moeder is om mysterieuze redenen opgegraven. Halsoverkop vertrekt ze naar haar geboorteplaatsje Swan, waar ze samen met haar broer de ware oorzaak van haar moeders dood probeert te achterhalen. Welke verborgen familiegeheimen komen nog meer aan het licht? De Amerikaanse Frances Mayes (1940) schrijft romans, gedichten en geprezen memoires over haar leven in Italië. Haar bekendste werk is ‘Een huis in Toscane’, waarin ze haar ontmoeting met de Italiaanse cultuur, de culinaire hoogstandjes en het betoverende landschap beschrijft. Het stond maar liefst twee jaar lang op de New York Times-bestsellerlijst en werd verfilmd met als titel ‘Under the Tuscan sun’, met Diane Lane in de hoofdrol. Andere bekende werken van Mayes zijn de memoires ‘Bella Toscane’, ‘Elke dag in Toscane’ en de roman ‘Het geheim van Swan’. Met haar schrijftalent en passie voor reizen en koken waant de lezer zich ogenblikkelijk in het idyllische Italië.

The Book of Love Laughter & Romance,"Rowdy, ecstatic, and sometimes stern, these teaching stories and fables reveal new and very human properties in Rumi's vision. Included here are the notorious “Latin parts” that Reynold Nicholson felt were too unseemly to appear in English in his 1920s translation. For Rumi, anything that human beings do—however compulsive—affords a glimpse into the inner life. Here are more than 40 fables or teaching stories that deal with love, laughter, death, betrayal, and the soul. The stories are exuberant, earthy, and bursting with vitality—much like a painting by Hieronymus Bosch or Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. The characters are guilty, lecherous, tricky, ribald, and finally possessors of opened souls. Barks writes: ""These teaching stories are a kind of scrimshaw—intricately carved, busy figures, confused and threatening, and weirdly funny. This is an entertaining collection from one of the greatest spiritual poets of all time, rendered by his most popular translator. “The minute I heard my first love story, I started looking for you, not knowing how blind that was.

Schooling As Violence,"The violent imagination begins in experiences of violation against the self and grows through the stories, myths, folktales and anecdotes of everyday life. Originally published in 1986, John Schostak discusses the educational, social and moral implications of the violent imagination in connection with theories of violence, childrearing practices, and schooling as a childrearing institution. He also looks at the relation between sexism, racism, drugs and the emergence of a vandalised sense of self. The book explores the complex ways in which images of violence pervade society, inform action and provide interpretations of events. Schools, the author argues, contribute towards the development of a violent imagination which guides judgements and actions. The child's images and experiences of violation may involve physical assault or psychological forms of assault. Some of these experiences of violation and violence are considered normal, even moral ('spare the rod and spoil the child'); others are considered abnormal, criminal, pathological - although the abstract logical form of each may be equivalent. Nevertheless, all such images contribute towards the development of a sense of violation, and children are schooled to accept normal forms and reject abnormal forms.","['John F Schostak', 'Taylor & Francis Group']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gA5ZzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=gA5ZzgEACAAJ&dq=Schooling+As+Violence&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2021-09,http://books.google.nl/books?id=gA5ZzgEACAAJ&dq=Schooling+As+Violence&hl=&source=gbs_api,,
"Guildbook: Sandmen (The Sandmen Sourcebook for Wraith: The Oblivion, Guildbook Two)","'Ik was stomverbaasd dat ik nog nooit van dit boek had gehoord. Voor mij is het even belangrijk als het dagboek van Anne Frank.' - Steve McQueen Solomon Northup, in 1808 als vrij man geboren in New York, wordt in 1841 ontvoerd en in het Zuiden verkocht als slaaf. Twaalf jaar lang werkt hij op plantages in Louisiana, vaak onder de meest wrede omstandigheden, altijd in de hoop zijn vrijheid terug te winnen. In 1853 komt Northup eindelijk vrij. In datzelfde jaar verschijnt 12 jaar slaaf, zijn eigen aangrijpende relaas van zijn gevangenschap in een van de donkerste periodes uit de Amerikaanse geschiedenis. Het boek slaat direct in als een bom en opent vele Amerikanen de ogen voor de onmenselijkheid van het slavernijsysteem. 12 Years a Slave is verfilmd door de Britse filmmaker Steve McQueen en werd geproduceerd door onder anderen Brad Pitt. De film won de Golden Globe voor Beste Film en is genomineerd voor negen Oscars, waaronder die voor Beste Film. Het boek verschijnt voor het eerst in Nederlandse vertaling.

Man-Kzin Wars IX,"THOSE KZIN DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY'RE LICKED (AND MAYBE THEY AREN'T . . . .) It was so unfair! Here the Kzin were, warcats supreme, bringing the galaxy piece by piece under feline dominion, carving out satrapies for the home planet like the lords of creation that they were¾and then they ran into those pesky humans. Mere apes! Contemptible salad-eaters! Taking pride in sneaking up on a leaf! Obviously fit only to be lunch, not even a speed bump in the Kzinti's imperial career. Hardly worth screaming-and-leaping about. But when the feline Kzin moved in to take over the monkey-occupied worlds¾they got clobbered. The humans, with their underhanded monkey cunning, turned communications equipment and space drives into weapons that cut the dauntless Heroes into ribbons. When the humans gained a faster-than-light drive, it `vas all over but the, uh, howling. The Kzin had lost their first war ever in centuries of conquest. Still, you can't keep a good warcat down, and the Kzin have by no means given up. New weapons, new strategies, and new leaders¾the humans had better keep their powder dry.

Chances Are,"One beautiful September day, three sixty-six-year-old men convene on Martha's Vineyard, friends ever since meeting in college in the 1960s. They couldn't have been more different then, or even today - Lincoln's a commercial real estate broker, Teddy a tiny-press publisher and Mickey an ageing musician. But each man holds his own secrets, in addition to the monumental mystery that none of them has ever stopped puzzling over since 1971: the disappearance of their friend Jacy. Now, decades later, the distant past interrupts the present as the truth about what happened to Jacy finally emerges, forcing the men to reconsider everything they thought they knew about each other. Shot through with Russo's trademark comedy and humanity, Chances Are also introduces a new level of suspense and menace that will quicken the reader's heartbeat throughout this absorbing saga of how friendship's bonds are every bit as constricting and rewarding as those of family.

Seven Perennial Sins and Their Offspring,"Who was it who asked, ""Why does the devil have all the good tunes?""The seven ""deadly sins"" are not to be found in scripture as such, but they have been a staple of Christian preaching since the early church. Ken BazynÆs The Seven Perennial Sins and Their Offspring is more indebted to literature than to personal experience, ethics, or the contemporary obsession with psychology. Drawing upon a vast storehouse of reading from a wide variety of disciplines, Bazyn offers a ""thick description"" of each of these ""root"" sins, setting them in a broad temporal, cultural, and human context. The range of reference is enormous. We are as likely to encounter Madame Bovary as Evagrius Ponticus, Jay Gatsby as Blaise Pascal, Francois Truffaut as Francis of Assisi, testifying to the perennial nature of the temptation to pride or anger, gluttony or sloth. We succumb to them over and over partly, says the author quoting Jorge Luis Borges, because ""our minds are porous with forgetfulness."" With the widespread adoption of the Revised Common Lectionary, topical preaching--on the creed, the ten commandments, the beatitudes--has fallen out of use. Thus the even greater need for a book like The Seven Perennial Sins. Without ever moralizing, by means of anecdote and story, the book provides a serious, but often amusing, account of the dark side of the human comedy.",['Ken Bazyn'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JXUtPQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=JXUtPQAACAAJ&dq=Seven+Perennial+Sins+and+Their+Offspring&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Bloomsbury Academic,2002-10-23,http://books.google.nl/books?id=JXUtPQAACAAJ&dq=Seven+Perennial+Sins+and+Their+Offspring&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],

Victorian Gothic Designs (International Design Library),"Designed by a master sculptor and woodcarver of the Victorian era (born 1823, died 1877), these superb ornaments are now available to all who are fascinated by the elements of Victorian Gothic style. Dragons and gargoyles abound, along with stylised birds and other animalistic shapes -- the very stuff of Victorian Gothic ornamentation. Ernst Plassman originally offered these designs, in the form of columns, plinths, borders, friezes and cornices, for use by artists, craftsmen and architects. Their successors today will find them of even greater value with the growing interest in all things Victorian. The introduction by Ramona Jablonski discusses this rare find, its place in art history and it adaptive uses today.",['Ramona Jablonski'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RXT5AAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=RXT5AAAACAAJ&dq=Victorian+Gothic+Designs+(International+Design+Library)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Stemmer House Pub,1981,http://books.google.nl/books?id=RXT5AAAACAAJ&dq=Victorian+Gothic+Designs+(International+Design+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Architecture'],

Sorcerer's Stone: A Beginner's Guide to Alchemy,"The author of this book, Dennis William Hauck, is a Hermetic scholar versed in both Eastern and Western techniques of alchemy and widely recognized as one of the world's leading experts on the subject. Now, in this book, he makes alchemy's secrets and powers accessible to everyone with the desire to experience physical, mental, and spiritual transformation. By providing clear explanations, moving meditations, and hands-on experiments making tinctures and elixirs, this beautifully illustrated guide passes on the knowledge and creative energy of alchemy's magnificent discipline—sending a golden arc of learning from thousands of years in the past into your life today. Hauck presents a fascinating history of alchemy—from the ancient Emerald Tablet to modern quantum chemistry – and elaborates on its arcane principles in an intimate, conversational way that anyone can understand.

Representing Reality: Issues and Concepts in Documentary,"This book offers a conceptual overview of documentary filmmaking practice. It addresses numerous social issues and how they are presented to the viewer by means of style, rhetoric, and narrative technique. The volume poses questions about the relationship of the documentary tradition to power, the body, authority, knowledge, and our experience of history. This study advances the pioneering work of Nichols's earlier book, Ideology and the Image. The rigorous discussion of modes of documentary representation, the relationship between narrative and nonfiction, and the representation of the body (including a chapter on pornography, ethnography, and power), give this book enormous value for the study of visual anthropology and ethnographic film. The often neglected relationship between signifier and referent is the special focus of this intensive study of documentary film. The concluding discussion of the representation of the body will also be of special interest to semioticians.",['Bill Nichols'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Jq2cS7qARd8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Jq2cS7qARd8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Representing+Reality:+Issues+and+Concepts+in+Documentary&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Indiana University Press,1991,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Jq2cS7qARd8C&dq=Representing+Reality:+Issues+and+Concepts+in+Documentary&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Performing Arts'],3.0
Living in Morocco: Design from Casablanca to Marrakesh,"Morocco is an exhilarating combination of vivid sensuality and intense spirituality, an intoxicating blend of cultures. Berber, Arab, French, English, and Spanish: the country's rich mixture of heritages is matched by its geography, which ranges from coast to mountain to desert. This revised edition of Living in Morocco celebrates the indigenous arts of a country at the height of a cultural renaissance. Morocco is known for fine leather and for pottery that dates back a thousand years. Berber rugs are justly famous, and there is a thriving tradition of woodworking, especially in the native thuya wood. Most extraordinary, though, is Morocco's decorative painting and tilework, where, forbidden by religion to depict human figures, craftsmen have developed a vocabulary of pattern and ornament. The book is filled with brightly colored ceilings, decorated courtyards and walls, plaster of Paris carved and painted in intricate geometrics, tiles so small that 150 could fit in a matchbox. Lavishly illustrated chapters on decorative and folk arts alternate with chapters on Moroccan life today. We visit Chaouen in the Rif Mountains (a city only recently open to Westerners), where the town's undulating surfaces are painted a bone-chilling blue-tinted white. We peer into an abandoned kasbah in the Sahara, and absorb the sights, sounds, and smells of the frenzied souk. We take time out in the shady blue-and-pink environs of the Majorelle Gardens, laid out by French painter Jacques Majorelle, and explore the story behind La Mamounia, the famous hotel that has welcomed such guests as Winston Churchill. Most important, we see Morocco's arts brought to life in its homesfrom former harems to traditional Hispano-Moorish houses. Glorious photographs make this a treasure for the armchair traveler, while the documentation of Morocco's houses, arts, and crafts make it an invaluable resource for decorators and designers. Published in hardcover under the title Morocco: Designs from Casablanca to Marrakesh. 346 color photographs.",,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tX1d9Q190d8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=tX1d9Q190d8C&dq=Living+in+Morocco:+Design+from+Casablanca+to+Marrakesh&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2001,http://books.google.nl/books?id=tX1d9Q190d8C&dq=Living+in+Morocco:+Design+from+Casablanca+to+Marrakesh&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Architecture'],1.0

"Cast, The","The story of the woman taken in adultery features a dramatic confrontation between Jesus and the Pharisees over whether the adulteress should be stoned as the law commands. In response, Jesus famously states, “Let him who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.” To Cast the First Stone traces the history of this provocative story from its first appearance to its enduring presence today. Likely added to the Gospel of John in the third century, the passage is often held up by modern critics as an example of textual corruption by early Christian scribes and editors, yet a judgment of corruption obscures the warm embrace the story actually received. Jennifer Knust and Tommy Wasserman trace the story’s incorporation into Gospel books, liturgical practices, storytelling, and art, overturning the mistaken perception that it was either peripheral or suppressed, even in the Greek East. The authors also explore the story’s many different meanings. Taken as an illustration of the expansiveness of Christ’s mercy, the purported superiority of Christians over Jews, the necessity of penance, and more, this vivid episode has invited any number of creative receptions. This history reveals as much about the changing priorities of audiences, scribes, editors, and scholars as it does about an “original” text of John. To Cast the First Stone calls attention to significant shifts in Christian book cultures and the enduring impact of oral tradition on the preservation—and destabilization—of scripture.","['Jennifer Knust', 'Tommy Wasserman']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Q5mzDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Q5mzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PR1&dq=Cast,+The&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Princeton University Press,2020-01-14,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Q5mzDwAAQBAJ&dq=Cast,+The&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Bibles'],

"The Selected Prose of John Gray (British Authors Ser, 1880-1920)","Publication of Ian Fletcher's The Poems of John Gray (1988) was welcomed by reviewers in the U.S. and England. Now ELT Press offers a companion volume, The Selected Prose of John Gray. It complements the poetry by printing essays and short stories chosen from different periods of Gray's life--some selections previously unpublished, others having appeared only in limited periodical circulation. This new book adds to our understanding of Gray and topics relevant to the era. Professor McCormack explains the importance of the prose in her introduction: Gray has a significance for his time as a writer who has made the transition from the mannered decadence of ""The Modern Actor"" to the cryptic pre-modernist narrative of Park. As such, his work helps us reconstruct our own past: in particular, it requires us to acknowledge that abyss which lies between the late Victorian and the years after the Great War. As one who survived, not only personally but as a writer, Gray allows us to speculate on the strategies by which he sought to bridge that chasm.

Free Frank: A Black Pioneer on the Antebellum Frontier,"The story of Free Frank is not only a testament to human courage and resourcefulness but affords new insight into the American frontier. Born a slave in the South Carolina piedmont in 1777, Frank died a free man in 1854 in a town he had founded in western Illinois. His accomplishments, creditable for any frontiersman, were for a black man extraordinary. We first learn details of Frank's life when in 1795 his owner moved to Pulaski County, Kentucky. We know that he married Lucy, a slave on a neighboring farm, in 1799. Later he was allowed to hire out his time, and when his owner moved to Tennessee, Frank was left in charge of the Kentucky farm. During the War of 1812, he set up his own saltpeter works, an enterprise he maintained until he left Kentucky. In 1817 he purchased his wife's freedom for $800; two years later he bought his own liberty for the same price. Now free, he expanded his activities, purchasing land and dealing in livestock. With his wife and four of his children, Free Frank left Kentucky in 1830 to settle on a new frontier. In Pike County, Illinois, he purchased a farm and later, in 1836, platted and successfully promoted the town of New Philadelphia. The desire for freedom was an obvious spur to his commercial efforts. Through his lifetime of work he purchased the liberty of sixteen members of his family at a cost of nearly $14,000. Goods and services commanded a premium in the life of the frontier. Free Frank's career shows what an exceptional man, through working against great odds, could accomplish through industry, acumen, and aggressiveness. His story suggests a great deal about business activity and legal practices, as well as racial conditions, on the frontier. Juliet Walker has performed a task of historical detection in recreating the life of Free Frank from family traditions, limited personal papers, public documents, and secondary sources. In doing so, she has added a significant chapter to the history of African Americans.",['Juliet E.K.

But that proved nearly impossible when Adam made his daughter's chaperon the subject of his relentless seduction. Adam knew any attention from him could destroy Lady Wyncherley's fine reputation. But he was powerless to control the strong desires she aroused in him. And all too soon this reformed rogue was hell-bent on convincing a very stubborn Annis to become his chaperon bride....",['Nicola Cornick'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Sg02isP8VLIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Sg02isP8VLIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Chaperon+Bride,+the+(Historical+Romance)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Harlequin,2009-05-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Sg02isP8VLIC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],

Crusade of the Left: The Lincoln battalion in the Spanish Civil War,"Between 1936 and 1938, some 3,000 young Americans sailed to France and crossed the Pyrenees to take part in the brutal civil war raging in Spain. Virtually all joined the International Brigades, formed under the auspices of the Soviet-led Comintern and largely directed by Communists. Yet a large number were not Communists; their activism was inspired by domestic and international crises of the 1930s, and colored by idealism.The men who went to Spain came out of a radical subculture that emerged from the Depression and the New Deal. Th is radicalism was a native plant, but it was nourished from abroad. In the thirties the menace of fascism seemed to be spreading like cancer across Europe, giving an international aspect to many domestic problems in the United States. To intellectuals, students, unionists, liberals, and leftists, the threat of fascism was so real that many came to believe that if it was not stopped in Spain, eventually they would have to take up arms against fascism at home.To understand the Americans who fought in the Spanish Civil War it is necessary to bury some of the shibboleths of cold war years. Dissidence in the United States occurs in response to perceptions of reality on this side of the Atlantic, not because of the wishes of men in the Soviet Union. Th e members of the Lincoln Battalion were genuine products of America, and their story is properly a page in American military and political history. From them, one can learn much about the world of the 1930s and perhaps even something about the potential of modern man for thought and action in time of crisis.",['Robert Rosenstone'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3PdKDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=3PdKDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Crusade+of+the+Left:+The+Lincoln+battalion+in+the+Spanish+Civil+War&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2018-02-06,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3PdKDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],

Language and Symbolic Power,"This volume brings together Pierre Bourdieu's highly original writings on language and on the relations among language, power, and politics. Bourdieu develops a forceful critique of traditional approaches to language, including the linguistic theories of Saussure and Chomsky and the theory of speech-acts elaborated by Austin and others. He argues that language should be viewed not only as a means of communication but also as a medium of power through which individuals pursue their own interests and display their practical competence. Drawing on the concepts that are part of his distinctive theoretical approach, Bourdieu maintains that linguistic utterances or expressions can be understood as the product of the relation between a ""linguistic market"" and a ""linguistic habitus."" When individuals use language in particular ways, they deploy their accumulated linguistic resources and implicitly adapt their words to the demands of the social field or market that is their audience. Hence every linguistic interaction, however personal or insignificant it may seem, bears the traces of the social structure that it both expresses and helps to reproduce. Bourdieu's account sheds fresh light on the ways in which linguistic usage varies according to considerations such as class and gender. It also opens up a new approach to the ways in which language is used in the domain of politics. For politics is, among other things, the arena in which words are deeds and the symbolic character of power is at stake. This volume, by one of the leading social thinkers in the world today, represents a major contribution to the study of language and power. It will be of interest to students throughout the social sciences and humanities, especially in sociology, politics, anthropology, linguistics, and literature.",['Pierre Bourdieu'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u2ZlGBiJntAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=u2ZlGBiJntAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Language+and+Symbolic+Power&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Harvard University Press,1991,http://books.google.nl/books?id=u2ZlGBiJntAC&dq=Language+and+Symbolic+Power&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],3.0

Improving Governance: A New Logic for Empirical Research (American Governance and Public Policy series),"Policymakers and public managers around the world have become preoccupied with the question of how their goals can be achieved in a way that rebuilds public confidence in government. Yet because public policies and programs increasingly are being administered through a complicated web of jurisdictions, agencies, and public-private partnerships, evaluating their effectiveness is more difficult than in the past. Though social scientists possess insightful theories and powerful methods for conducting empirical research on governance and public management, their work is too often fragmented and irrelevant to the specific tasks faced by legislators, administrators, and managers. Proposing a framework for research based on the premise that any particular governance arrangement is embedded in a wider social, fiscal, and political context, Laurence E. Lynn Jr., Carolyn J. Heinrich, and Carolyn J. Hill argue that theory-based empirical research, when well conceived and executed, can be a primary source of fundamental, durable knowledge about governance and policy management. Focusing on complex human services such as public assistance, child protection, and public education, they construct an integrative, multilevel ""logic of governance,"" that can help researchers increase the sophistication, power, and relevance of their work.","['Laurence E.

Global human rights offered individuals unprecedented guarantees beyond the nation for the protection of political, economic, social and cultural freedoms. The World Reimagined explores how these revolutionary developments first became believable to Americans in the 1940s and the 1970s through everyday vernaculars as they emerged in political and legal thought, photography, film, novels, memoirs and soundscapes. Together, they offered fundamentally novel ways for Americans to understand what it means to feel free, culminating in today's ubiquitous moral language of human rights.

Those with lung cancer suffer more blame and stigma than other cancer patients, even though 50 percent of them are former smokers or have never smoked. Treatments for lung cancer can significantly impact quality of life, and the prognosis for some types and stages of lung cancer, using standard treatments, can be daunting. In straightforward language,Lung Cancer: Making Sense of Diagnosis, Treatment & Optionsaddresses medical, emotional, and support needs, often in the words of patients and families themselves. Topics include: Diagnosis and medical tests Characteristics of the lung cancers, factors in prognosis, and the various subtypes and staging systems for the disease Treatments, including standard treatments for the subtypes, as well as emerging research and promising treatments now in clinical trials Side effects and long-term effects of treatment, including how to cope and how to improve quality of life Emotional responses to diagnosis, treatment, remission, possible recurrence, and other aspects of dealing with the condition, including stories from dozens of families living with lung cancer Getting support from family, friends, employers, and the broader community Comprehensive list of lung cancer resources: organizations, print, online sites Other resources, including a pull-out Cancer Survivor's Treatment Record, glossary, bibliography, and technical appendices Author and patient advocate Lorraine Johnston, with her background in life sciences, emphasizes using knowledge to dispel fear. The content has been reviewed by top medical experts and physicians in the field. Those who read this book will encounter medical facts simply explained, advice to ease their daily life, and tools to be strong advocates for themselves or a family member.",['Lorraine Johnston'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2scLAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2scLAAAACAAJ&dq=Lung+Cancer:+Making+Sense+of+Diagnosis,+Treatment,+and+Options&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Patient-Centered Guides,2001,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2scLAAAACAAJ&dq=Lung+Cancer:+Making+Sense+of+Diagnosis,+Treatment,+and+Options&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Family & Relationships'],

"Working Class Cultures in Britain, 1890-1960: Gender, Class and Ethnicity","Integrating a variety of historical approaches and methods, Joanna Bourke looks at the construction of class within the intimate contexts of the body, the home, the marketplace, the locality and the nation to assess how the subjective identity of the 'working class' in Britain has been maintained through seventy years of radical social, cultural and economic change. She argues that class identity is essentially a social and cultural rather than an institutional or political phenomenon and therefore cannot be understood without constant reference to gender and ethnicity. Each self contained chapter consists of an essay of historical analysis, introducing students to the ways historians use evidence to understand change, as well as useful chronologies, statistics and tables, suggested topics for discussion, and selective further reading.","['Prof Joanna Bourke', 'Joanna Bourke']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XXCNZNuWhjkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=XXCNZNuWhjkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Working+Class+Cultures+in+Britain,+1890-1960:+Gender,+Class+and+Ethnicity&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Routledge,2008-01-28,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XXCNZNuWhjkC&source=gbs_api,['History'],

"The Ever Changing Organization: Creating the Capacity for Continuous Change, Learning, and Improvement","If you are: overwhelmed by the amount of change and the difficulty in making it happen, finding failure - or limited success - with the implementation of changes, disappointed in the growth or financial performance of your organization, and are looking for a strategy for improving your organization's capacity for planned and proactive change, this book is for you. The world is continuing to change at a rapid pace, while most organizations are focused on maintaining stability and certainty. The price of this growing gap is the diversion of limited resources to reactive, fire-fighting behaviors and the inability to lead and be proactive. Allowing the gap to continue to grow is the formula for failure, this book gives you the formula for success. In The EverChanging Organization, the authors present a model of the EverChanging Organization(ECO). This is a systems model for understanding an organization's needed capacity for change in a range of change orientations from change averse to change seeking. The book includes diagnostic scales, tools for assessing need and status as an ECO, and a process for selecting and implementing change initiatives to achieve the needed capacity for change in timely and cost effective ways.",['Gerald R Pieters'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BRwuDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BRwuDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Ever+Changing+Organization:+Creating+the+Capacity+for+Continuous+Change,+Learning,+and+Improvement&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Routledge,2017-07-12,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BRwuDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],

Latin for Beginners (Language Guides),"Earn-lay atin-Lay? No, not that kind of Latin! You can learn true Latin, with conjugations, declensions, and all those extra syllables – and it’s easier than you think. In fact, most people mistakenly think of learning Latin as perhaps the most useless, tedious, and difficult thing to do on earth. They couldn’t be more wrong. Latin For Dummies takes you back for a quick jaunt through the parlance of ancient Rome, as well as discussing the progress of Latin into church language, and its status today as the “dead” language that lives on in English, Spanish, Italian, and most other Western tongues. Written for those with zero prior knowledge of Latin, this snappy guide puts the basics at your fingertips and steers clear of the arcane, schoolmarm stereotype of endless declensions and Herculean translations. Easy-to-understand sections describe: Latin you already know Grammar Pronunciation Latin in action Latin in law Latin in medicine Latin for impressing your friends And much more No dusty tome or other such artifact, Latin For Dummies makes learning fun and brings the language to life by presenting conversations in various Roman settings, as well as providing fun facts and stories about classical life. And if you feel you may actually have a negative aptitude for the language, don’t worry; pronunciations and translations follow every expression, and a helpful mini-dictionary graces the book’s last pages. You’ll also find out about: The quotable Roman Latin graffiti Latin authors who’s who Gladiator Latin Latin in love, marriage, and family From the mouth of Julius Caesar Romans on drink Helpful Latin-related Web sites Fun and games exercises Designed to introduce and familiarize you with the language rather than make you the next Cicero, Latin For Dummies gives you all the tools you need to work at your own pace to learn as much or as little as you like.

The Man Who Talks to Dogs: The Story of America's Wild Street Dogs and Their Unlikely Savior,"Go to any unpopulated or abandoned area in any given urban setting, and you'll find them. Thousands and thousands of wild dogs-abandoned to disease, starvation, and inevitable death-are leading short and brutal lives in the no-man's-land between domestication and wildness, byproducts of the human destitution around them. A lucky few are saved by dedicated rescuers, and Randy Grim, has emerged as one of the country's leading dog saviors. After years of rescuing dogs on his own, he founded Stray Rescue of St. Louis, an organization dedicated to rescue and rehabilitation. These are dogs that belong to no one, the ones animal-control experts can't catch and humane shelters won't deal with. They are stray or feral, either abandoned or born wild on the streets, which means they won't come near humans and statistically won't live past their second year. And their numbers are growing every day.

Change and Continuity in Spatial Planning,"Change and Continuity in Spatial Planning addresses a question of enduring interest to planners: can planning really bring about significant and positive change? In South Africa the process of political transition appeared to create the preconditions for planners to demonstrate how their traditional humanitarian and environmental concerns could find concrete expression in the reshaping of the built environment. Integral to this story is how planning practices have been shaped by the past, in a rapidly changing context characterised by a globalising economy, new systems of governance, a changing political ideology, and a culture of intensifying poverty and diversity. More broadly, the book addresses the issue of how planners use power, in situations which themselves represent networks of power relations, where both planners and those they engage with operate through frames of reference fundamentally shaped by place and history.",['Vanessa Watson'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1MqAAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=1MqAAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Change+and+Continuity+in+Spatial+Planning&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2003-12-16,http://books.google.nl/books?id=1MqAAgAAQBAJ&dq=Change+and+Continuity+in+Spatial+Planning&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Architecture'],

Where the Cypress Rises,"History, tradition, art and festivals and friendship are the themes that Australian artist Virginia Ryan effortlessly interweaves throughout her intriguing personal memoir. 'Where the Cypress Rises' tells the story of her family's growing affection for a hill town in central Italy. ""It was midsummer. The thick, cloying blanket of afternoon heat spread itself drowsily across the Umbrian landscape, leaving the earth scorched under a sun-bleached sky. On far-off mountaintops storms were brewing and distant thunder seemed to rise from a sunstruck earth, an incantation from other times. We drove on and on in a trance towards the hill town of Trevi, only casting aside weariness with the excitement of seeing our new home again. The recently acquired object of our desires was an abandoned olive mill clinging to the edge of tree-lined slopes on the outskirts of the town, purchased quite impulsively the previous summer.""",['Virginia Ryan'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4kVIjddzRTMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=4kVIjddzRTMC&pg=PA38&dq=Where+the+Cypress+Rises&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Strictly Literary,2008,http://books.google.nl/books?id=4kVIjddzRTMC&dq=Where+the+Cypress+Rises&hl=&source=gbs_api,"['Artists, Australian']",

The Pro: Lessons from My Father About Golf and Life,"Butch Harmon is the world’s number one golf coach. He taught Tiger Woods through one of the greatest stretches of victories in golf history (and, perhaps even more conspicuously, did not teach Tiger Woods following his unprecedented run), as well as superstars like Greg Norman, Adam Scott, Fred Couples, Darren Clarke, Natalie Gulbis, and Davis Love III. How did he become such a legendary teacher and mentor? The answer is simple: He learned from watching his father. The Harmons are the First Family of golf, and Claude Harmon, Sr., was the greatest of them all. His skill as a player, an innovator, a teacher, a devoted father, a loyal friend, and a peer of giants such as Ben Hogan has gone largely unappreciated by all but those who knew him best. In this book by his son, he finally gets his due. In The Pro, Butch Harmon paints a compelling portrait of an era in sports before the emergence of big media and bigger money, and shows how the lessons he learned about life and golf at his father’s knee made him the man he is today. The Pro is both a family and a golf memoir, as well as an inside look at what it takes to teach the Tigers of the world. It describes how Butch and his brothers, who are also teachers, transfer their father’s unique wit, wisdom, and philosophy to the next generation of golfers. Sometimes their advice relates to the game, sometimes they simply offer words of encouragement and motivation, sometimes they make pointed criticisms intended to shock their students into focus, and sometimes they try to impart simple advice about “walking around through life.” The Harmon brothers are teachers who share a special quality: All of their lessons are passed down from their father. Millions of golf fans know Butch Harmon; many are even familiar with his father and brothers. But never before have we been given such an intimate look at life among the legends of golf. The Pro is the story of an extraordinary father and son that will resonate with anyone who has ever looked back on life and recognized the wisdom of their parents’ teachings. ""Golf's hard,"" Dad would say, pointing a meaty finger at me as if he were about to reveal the secret of the Rosetta Stone. “Good golf is damn hard, and championship golf is something only a few will ever see. But that’s how it should be. If it were easy, everybody would do it. And where’s the fun in that?” From Butch Harmon, the world’s number one golf coach, comes the inside story of how he learned everything he knows about golf and life from his father, Claude Harmon, Sr. Both a family memoir and a reminiscence of growing up among the legends of sport, The Pro is a portrait of one extraordinary family and the game that will carry their legacy for years to come.",['Butch Harmon'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zJf8OcVoBNYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=zJf8OcVoBNYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Pro:+Lessons+from+My+Father+About+Golf+and+Life&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Crown,2006-05-09,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zJf8OcVoBNYC&source=gbs_api,['Sports & Recreation'],

Wallace Stevens: A Poet's Growth,"In Wallace Stevens: A Poet’s Growth, George S. Lensing examines Stevens’ gradual emergence and development as a poet, tracing his life from his formative years in Pennsylvania to his careers as a lawyer for the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company and as one of the major poets of the twentieth century. Lensing draws extensively upon previously unpublished material from the Stevens archive at the Huntington Library, which contains letters, early drafts of poems, and notebooks. Two notebooks,Schemata and From Pieces of Paper, are here reproduced in full. The study is divided into three sections. In the first, Lensing examines the years before the publication of Sevens’ first volume of poetry, paying special attention to the forces that hindered and enhanced his progress toward modernity. In the second, we see Stevens in the exercise of his craft. Lensing discusses the influence of the Romantics on the verse Stevens wrote as an undergraduate at Harvard; his interest in Oriental art, Cubism, and Fauvism; his anticipation of Imagism; and his imitation of certain French Symbolists. Sources of the epigraphs to Stevens’ poems are identified fully for the first time, suggesting the role of Stevens’ vast reading upon his poetry. Also considered is Stevens’ voluminous correspondence with people from all over the world, some of whom he never met personally. These letters helped rescue Stevens from the insularity of his business life and aided in the making of his poems. The final section treats the critical responses to Stevens’ poetry by such people as Harriet Monroe, editor and founder of Poetry, who was the first important reader and publisher of his work. Attention is also given to Stevens’ explications of his poems. Wallace Stevens: A Poet’s Growth is a comprehensive examination of Stevens’ live and work. This study provides abundant new material, which will be of value to scholars and to those readers who are drawn to Stevens’ poetry.",['George S.

Dick Bong: Ace of Aces,"Major Richard “Dick” Ira Bong died at the tender age of 24 on the 6th August 1945 in a flight accident during testing of the P-80 Shooting Star Fighter. His fame was such that news of his death vied with the atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima in the US press, his legendary exploits at the helm of his P-38 Lightning had made him a household name. Bong had only recently received the Congressional Medal of Honor for his exploits of downing 40 enemy Japanese planes in the Southwestern Pacific. His tally of 40 victories made him the highest scoring American ace of all time, a record that is unlikely to ever be broken. In this biography his former commanding officer General George C. Kenney recounts his life; from his early life in Wisconsin, his sweetheart Marge, and his aerial exploits. Kenney enriches the narrative with personal anecdotes that illuminate the modest unassuming but determinedly heroic, Ace of Aces. Highly recommended.",['General George C.

Focusing on literary representations and selected examples from the visual arts, this book examines works by Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Christina Rossetti, George Eliot, Alfred Lord Tennyson and Walter Pater as well as by John Ruskin, Maria Rossetti and Arthur Henry Hallam. Julia Straub's analysis shows how the various representations of Beatrice in literature and in the visual arts reflect in meaningful ways some of the central social and aesthetic concerns of the Victorian period, most importantly its discourse on gender.

Your Signature Work: Creating Excellence and Influencing Others at Work,"Are you bored in your job? Has the newness worn off so much so that you dread going to work every day? Have you ever felt as if your tasks––whether in a big organization or at home––just didn’t really contribute to anything significant? Do you often speculate about how much more influence you could have if you worked in a more visible or critical role––like may be a doctor, a pastor, a congressional representative? If so, then this book will inspire you to take a more reflective look at where you work, how you work, and who you influence. You’ll explore challenges such as these: · Finding the right job · Finding your calling in life · How to find purpose in life · Doing your best at work and what that looks like practically speaking As a companion to the earlier book Your Signature Life by the same author, Your Signature Work expands on the concept of doing your personal best at work so that it reflects your goals, values, beliefs, and faith. Using a sports analogy (basketball), this companion book will challenge you to see your tasks and job—whether parenting, building a forklift, stocking shelves, selling pharmaceuticals, or analyzing computer glitches––as an opportunity for leadership and service to others. As you strive for personal excellence, you'll identify ways to influence others in your workplace to “live” their values and faith. Even if you feel trapped in a dissatisfying job or a seemingly insignificant career, your work matters to God and to others in need. Your attitude can make all the difference in how you view your job, and the results you achieve! When you find your true calling, your work will be a source of satisfaction and fulfillment. And as an artist does, you will be proud to sign your name to work! Author and speaker Dianna Booher shares the same in-depth insights that she offers to churches and her Fortune 500 clients during keynotes and workshops. As founder and CEO of Booher Research, she’s an internationally recognized leadership communication and executive presence expert.

THE ELEMENTS OF STYLE,"Stephen King, Over leven en schrijven `Een meesterverteller.' VPRO Gids `Hoe doet King dat toch?' vroeg Joost Zwagerman zich al af in de Volkskrant. Hoe slaagt King er toch telkens weer in zijn lezers aan zich te binden en ze te verrassen? Hierover gaat Over leven en schrijven. Stephen King verhaalt over zijn jeugd, zijn puberjaren en zijn studietijd. Over de jaren na zijn doorbraak als schrijver, met Carrie, waarin succes en stress hem achtervolgen en de drank een uitvlucht biedt. Over het ongeluk dat hem in 1999 bijna het leven kost. En hoe hij er weer bovenop komt door zijn onweerstaanbare drang tot schrijven. Over wat hem inspireert en hoe hij te werk gaat. En natuurlijk laat King zijn licht schijnen over het belangrijkste wapen van elke schrijver: de pen die de auteur altijd in de aanslag moet hebben. Over leven en schrijven is een bron van inspiratie, voor zowel lezers als (aspirant-)schrijvers. Stephen King (1947) heeft meer dan tweehonderd verhalen op zijn naam staan, waaronder vijftig thriller- en fantasy-titels, alle wereldwijde bestsellers, waaronder Under the Dome (Gevangen), 22-11-1963, De Donkere Toren-reeks, Joyland,De Shining en Dr. Sleep.",['Stephen King'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UGEtDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=UGEtDgAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=THE+ELEMENTS+OF+STYLE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Luitingh Sijthoff,2013-10-31,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UGEtDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],

Illuminated Manuscripts of Medieval Spain,"At the end of the first millennium--when many expected the world to end--the Christian communities of Spain, still dominated by Islam, experienced a profound spiritual crisis. To make sense of their predicament, they turned to The Book of Revelation by St. John the Divine, and commentaries on this work were circulated in a variety of illuminated manuscripts of extraordinary expressive power. More than twenty of these manuscripts survive, dating from between 900 and 1100, all rendered in a colorful style known as Mozarabic. Cut off from the rest of Europe and obsessed by the imminence of God's judgment, the creators of these books invented a world peopled by angelic warriors, demons and beasts, exotic birds and serpents, and luxuriant trees.",['Mireille Mentre'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=p83mAQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=p83mAQAACAAJ&dq=Illuminated+Manuscripts+of+Medieval+Spain&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Todtri Book Pub,2003-03-01,http://books.google.nl/books?id=p83mAQAACAAJ&dq=Illuminated+Manuscripts+of+Medieval+Spain&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Art'],

Nappily Ever After,"NOW A NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM STARRING SANAA LATHAN What happens when you toss tradition out the window and really start living for yourself? Venus Johnston has a great job, a beautiful home, and a loving live-in boyfriend named Clint, who happens to be a drop-dead gorgeous doctor. She also has a weekly beauty-parlor date with Tina, who keeps Venus's long, processed hair slick and straight. But when Clint--who's been reluctant to commit over the past four years--brings home a puppy instead of an engagement ring, Venus decides to give it all up. She trades in her long hair for a dramatically short, natural cut and sends Clint packing. It's a bold declaration of independence--one that has effects she never could have imagined. Reactions from friends and coworkers range from concern to contempt to outright condemnation. And when Clint moves on and starts dating a voluptuous, long-haired beauty, Venus is forced to question what she really wants out of life. With wit, resilience, and a lot of determination, she finally learns what true happiness is--on her own terms.

"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror","In this brilliant look at the rise of political Islam, the distinguished political scientist and anthropologist Mahmood Mamdani brings his expertise and insight to bear on a question many Americans have been asking since 9/11: how did this happen? Mamdani dispels the idea of “good” (secular, westernized) and “bad” (premodern, fanatical) Muslims, pointing out that these judgments refer to political rather than cultural or religious identities. The presumption that there are “good” Muslims readily available to be split off from “bad” Muslims masks a failure to make a political analysis of our times. This book argues that political Islam emerged as the result of a modern encounter with Western power, and that the terrorist movement at the center of Islamist politics is an even more recent phenomenon, one that followed America’s embrace of proxy war after its defeat in Vietnam. Mamdani writes with great insight about the Reagan years, showing America’s embrace of the highly ideological politics of “good” against “evil.” Identifying militant nationalist governments as Soviet proxies in countries such as Nicaragua and Afghanistan, the Reagan administration readily backed terrorist movements, hailing them as the “moral equivalents” of America’s Founding Fathers. The era of proxy wars has come to an end with the invasion of Iraq. And there, as in Vietnam, America will need to recognize that it is not fighting terrorism but nationalism, a battle that cannot be won by occupation. Good Muslim, Bad Muslim is a provocative and important book that will profoundly change our understanding both of Islamist politics and the way America is perceived in the world today.",['Mahmood Mamdani'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=W69rBkP3W7QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=W69rBkP3W7QC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Good+Muslim,+Bad+Muslim:+America,+the+Cold+War,+and+the+Roots+of+Terror&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Harmony,2005-06-21,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=W69rBkP3W7QC&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],4.0
Pushing Ice,"First contact with extraordinary aliens, glittering technologies that could destroy the universe in a nanosecond, huge sweeping space operas: Alastair Reynolds is back! Some centuries from now, the exploration and exploitation of the Solar System is in full swing. On the cold edge of the system, Bella Lind, captain of the huge commercial spacecraft Rockhopper IV, helps fuel this new gold rush by attaching mass-driver motors to organic-rich water-ice comets to move them back to the inner worlds. Her crew are tough, blue-collar miners, engineers and demolition experts. Around Saturn, something inexplicable happens: one of the moons leaves its orbit and accelerates out of the Solar System. The icy mantle peels away to reveal that it was never a moon in the first place, just a parked spacecraft, millions of years old, that has now decided to move on. Rockhopper IV, trapped in the pull, is hurled across time and space into the deep, distant future, arriving in a vast, alien-constructed chamber. And the crew are not alone, for each chamber contains an alien culture dragged into this cosmic menagerie at the end of time. The crew of the Rockhopper IV know a lot about blowing up comets, but not much about first contact with ultra-advanced aliens. They have two things to worry about: can they (and their new alien allies) negotiate their way through each harrying contact? And can they assimilate the avalanche of knowledge about their own future - including all the glittering, dangerous technologies that are now theirs for the taking - without destroying themselves in the process?",['Alastair Reynolds'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u8GGpHHG_kkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=u8GGpHHG_kkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Pushing+Ice&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Hachette UK,2009-12-10,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=u8GGpHHG_kkC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],29.0

The Case That Never Dies: The Lindbergh Kidnapping,"Essential reading for anyone interested in the most famous American crime of the twentieth century Since its original publication in 2004, The Case That Never Dies has become the standard account of the Lindbergh Kidnapping. Now, in a new afterword, historian Lloyd C. Gardner presents a surprise conclusion based on recently uncovered pieces of evidence that were missing from the initial investigation as well as an evaluation of Charles Lindbergh’s role in the search for the kidnappers. Out of the controversies surrounding the actions of Colonel Lindbergh, Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of the New Jersey State Police, and FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, Gardner presents a well-reasoned argument for what happened on the night of March 1, 1932. The Case That NeverDies places the Lindbergh kidnapping, investigation, and trial in the context of the Depression, when many feared the country was on the edge of anarchy. Gardner delves deeply into the aspects of the case that remain confusing to this day, including Lindbergh’s dealings with crime baron Owney Madden, Al Capone’s New York counterpart, as well as the inexplicable exploits of John Condon, a retired schoolteacher who became the prosecution’s best witness. The initial investigation was hampered by Colonel Lindbergh, who insisted that the police not attempt to find the perpetrator because he feared the investigation would endanger his son’s life. He relented only when the child was found dead. After two years of fruitless searching, Bruno Richard Hauptmann, a German immigrant, was discovered to have some of the ransom money in his possession. Hauptmann was arrested, tried, and sentenced to death. Throughout the book, Gardner pays special attention to the evidence of the case and how it was used and misused in the trial. Whether Hauptmann was guilty or not, Gardner concludes that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of first-degree murder. Set in historical context, the book offers not only a compelling read, but a powerful vantage point from which to observe the United States in the 1930s as well as contemporary arguments over capital punishment.",['Lloyd Gardner'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yyDXhhNjkYwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=yyDXhhNjkYwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Case+That+Never+Dies:+The+Lindbergh+Kidnapping&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Rutgers University Press,2012-06-12,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yyDXhhNjkYwC&source=gbs_api,['History'],

The Illuminati formula used to create an undetectable total mind controlled slave,"When the mind and emotions are put under extreme stress they ""break"" and create a new mental-emotional state. It is within these mental states - born of trauma - that the mind can be conditioned. That someone would do this intentionally is unthinkable yet it has been done and tested to the degree of a science. ""Trauma Based Mind Control"" has been used by criminal organizations to maintain secrecy and ensure every order is followed to the letter. Through this process you get the Undetectable Total Mind Controlled Slave. Trauma Based Mind Control creates separate personalities within the individual that will carry out their duty with robotic exactness and then ""sleep"" so that the individual has no memory of their actions. These people are used as messengers, drug mules, sexual blackmail slaves and are placed in positions close to the worlds most powerful people. In short, they are used to manipulate and control the lives of the world elite.

Wal-Mart: The Face of Twenty-First-Century Capitalism,"A collection of essays that “do an incredible job of balancing the wonders and horrors of the force that is Wal-Mart” (Booklist, starred review). Edited by one of the nation’s preeminent labor historians, this book marks an ambitious effort to dissect the full extent of Wal-Mart’s business operations, its social effects, and its role in the United States and world economy. Wal-Mart is based on a spring 2004 conference of leading historians, business analysts, sociologists, and labor leaders that immediately attracted the attention of the national media, drawing profiles in the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and the New York Review of Books. Their contributions are adapted here for a general audience. At the end of the nineteenth century, the Pennsylvania Railroad declared itself “the standard of the world.” In more recent years, IBM and then Microsoft seemed the template for a new, global information economy. But at the dawn of the twenty-first century, Wal-Mart had overtaken all rivals as the world-transforming economic institution of our time. Presented in an accessible format and extensively illustrated with charts and graphs, Wal-Mart examines such topics as the giant retailer’s managerial culture, revolutionary use of technological innovation, and controversial pay and promotional practices to provide the most complete guide yet available to one of America’s largest companies. “Like archaeologists who pick over artifacts to understand an ancient society, the scholars here [are] examining Wal-Mart for insights into the very nature of American capitalist culture.” —The New York Times “Stimulating perspectives on the world’s largest corporation.” —Publishers Weekly",['Nelson Lichtenstein'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OEqdL9wZMuIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=OEqdL9wZMuIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Wal-Mart:+The+Face+of+Twenty-First-Century+Capitalism&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,The New Press,2016-02-02,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OEqdL9wZMuIC&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],
Social Psychology,"The first volume in this innovative two-volume set provides a comprehensive exploration of the major developments of social psychological theories that have taken place over the past half century, culminating in a state of the art overview of the primary theories and models that have been developed in this vast and fascinating field. Volume One covers Biological/Evolutionary Level of Analysis, Cognitive Level of Analysis, Content Model and Motivational and Affective Level of Analysis. Authored by leading international experts, each chapter represents a personal and historical narrative of the theory’s development including the inspirations, critical junctures, and problem-solving efforts that effected theoretical choices and determined the theory’s impact and its evolution. Unique to this handbook, these narratives provide a rich background for understanding how theories are created, nurtured, and shaped over time, and examining their unique contribution to the field as a whole. To examine its societal impact, each theory is evaluated in terms of its applicability to better understanding and solving critical social issues and problems. The Handbook of Theories of Social Psychology, Volume One is an essential resource for researchers and students of social psychology and related disciplines.","['Paul A M Van Lange', 'Arie W Kruglanski', 'E Tory Higgins']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N_PDGn_EhdwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=N_PDGn_EhdwC&dq=Social+Psychology&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,SAGE Publications,2012,http://books.google.nl/books?id=N_PDGn_EhdwC&dq=Social+Psychology&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Psychology'],

King Rat,"Japanese POW camp Changi, Singapore: hell on earth for the soldiers contained within its barbed wire walls. Officers and enlisted men, all prisoners together, yet the old hierarchies and rivalries survive. An American corporal, known as the King, has used his personality and wiles to facilitate trading with guards and locals to get needed food, supplies, even information into the camp. The imprisoned upper-class officers have never had to do things for themselves, and now they are reduced to wearing rags while the King’s clean shirt, gained through guts and moxie, seems like luxury in comparison. In the camp, everything has its price and everything is for sale. But trading is illegal—and the King has made a formidable enemy. Robin Grey, the provost marshal, hates the King and all he represents. Grey, though he grew up modestly, fervently believes in the British class system: everyone should know their place, and he knows the King’s place is at the bottom. The King does have a friend in Peter Marlowe, who, though wary of the King and himself a product of the British system, finds himself drawn to the charismatic man who just might be the only one who can save them from both the inhumanity of the prison camp but also from themselves. Powerful and engrossing, King Rat artfully weaves the author’s own World War II prison camp experiences into a compelling narrative of survival amidst the grim realities of war and what men can do when pushed to the edge.

My mass,"The Mass in My Life is the story of a Catholic laywoman's lifelong experience of the Mass. She recaptures childhood experiences, traces a path to adulthood, and in her elder years finds a wondrous gratitude for the Mass. Along the way, family, friends, pastors, favorite authors, and the Mass itself lighten her way as she seeks, in the words of an old missal, ""the God who is the joy of my youth."" Personal and family memories are recalled side-by-side with selected prayers of the Mass from her collection of missals that covers seven decades. The meaning of the Mass unfolds as the years go by, marked by ordinary days as well as rites of passage. Each chapter focuses on a milestone or period in the author's life and a prayer from the Order of the Mass. The two themes, life and Mass, interweave chronologically in a unique twofold structure. There are rich and sometimes troubling memories of personal and family life here, but always an attentive longing for the Mass which the author sees as the transforming experience of her life.",['Rosemary Lunardini'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wvvrVJ53nk4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=wvvrVJ53nk4C&pg=PT148&dq=My+mass&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,iUniverse,2009-01-17,http://books.google.nl/books?id=wvvrVJ53nk4C&dq=My+mass&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],

What Would Jefferson Say?,"PREFACE. THE Author of this very practical treatise on Scotch Loch - Fishing desires clearly that it may be of use to all who had it. He does not pretend to have written anything new, but to have attempted to put what he has to say in as readable a form as possible. Everything in the way of the history and habits of fish has been studiously avoided, and technicalities have been used as sparingly as possible. The writing of this book has afforded him pleasure in his leisure moments, and that pleasure would be much increased if he knew that the perusal of it would create any bond of sympathy between himself and the angling community in general. This section is interleaved with blank shects for the readers notes. The Author need hardly say that any suggestions addressed to the case of the publishers, will meet with consideration in a future edition. We do not pretend to write or enlarge upon a new subject. Much has been said and written-and well said and written too on the art of fishing but loch-fishing has been rather looked upon as a second-rate performance, and to dispel this idea is one of the objects for which this present treatise has been written. Far be it from us to say anything against fishing, lawfully practised in any form but many pent up in our large towns will bear us out when me say that, on the whole, a days loch-fishing is the most convenient. One great matter is, that the loch-fisher is depend- ent on nothing but enough wind to curl the water, -and on a large loch it is very seldom that a dead calm prevails all day, -and can make his arrangements for a day, weeks beforehand whereas the stream- fisher is dependent for a good take on the state of the water and however pleasant and easy it may be for one living near the banks of a good trout stream or river, it is quite another matter to arrange for a days river-fishing, if one is looking forward to a holiday at a date some weeks ahead. Providence may favour the expectant angler with a good day, and the water in order but experience has taught most of us that the good days are in the minority, and that, as is the case with our rapid running streams, -such as many of our northern streams are, -the water is either too large or too small, unless, as previously remarked, you live near at hand, and can catch it at its best. A common belief in regard to loch-fishing is, that the tyro and the experienced angler have nearly the same chance in fishing, -the one from the stern and the other from the bow of the same boat. Of all the absurd beliefs as to loch-fishing, this is one of the most absurd. Try it. Give the tyro either end of the boat he likes give him a cast of ally flies he may fancy, or even a cast similar to those which a crack may be using and if he catches one for every three the other has, he may consider himself very lucky. Of course there are lochs where the fish are not abundant, and a beginner may come across as many as an older fisher but we speak of lochs where there are fish to be caught, and where each has a fair chance. Again, it is said that the boatman has as much to do with catching trout in a loch as the angler. Well, we dont deny that. In an untried loch it is necessary to have the guidance of a good boatman but the same argument holds good as to stream-fishing...",['Dumas Malone'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=M18UambLINQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=M18UambLINQC&dq=What+Would+Jefferson+Say%3F&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Warren Press,2007-03,http://books.google.nl/books?id=M18UambLINQC&dq=What+Would+Jefferson+Say%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],

Copper Plate Photogravure: Demystifying the Process,"Copper Plate Photogravure describes in comprehensive detail the technique of traditional copper plate photogravure as would be practiced by visual artists using normally available facilities and materials. Attention is paid to step-by-step guidance through the many stages of the process. A detailed manual of technique, Copper Plate Photogravure also offers the history of the medium and reference to past alternative methods of practice. Copper Plate Photogravure: Demystifying the Process is part of the current revitalization of one of the most satisfyingly beautiful image-making processes. The range of ink color and paper quality possibilities is endless. The potential for handwork and alteration of the copper plate provides yet another realm of expressive variation. The subject matter and the treatment are as variable and broad as photography itself. This book's purpose is to demystify and clarify what is a complex but altogether ""do-able"" photomechanical process using currently available materials. With Copper Plate Photogravure, you will learn how to: · produce a full-scale film positive from a photographic negative · sensitize the gravure tissue to prepare it for exposure to the positive · prepare the plate and develop the gelatin resist prior to etching · prepare the various strengths of etching solutions and etch the plate to achieve a full tonal scale · rework the plate using printmaking tools to correct flaws or to adjust the image for aesthetic reasons · use the appropriate printing inks, ink additives, quality papers, and printshop equipment to produce a high quality print A historical survey and appendices of detailed technical information, charts, and tables are included, as well as a list of suppliers and sources for the materials required, some of which are highly specialized. A comprehensive glossary introduces the non-photographer or non-printmaker to many of the terms particular to those fields and associated with this process.","['David Morrish', 'Marlene MacCallum']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=viCoBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=viCoBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Copper+Plate+Photogravure:+Demystifying+the+Process&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,CRC Press,2003-04-03,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=viCoBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Photography'],

The Gnashing of Teeth,"A young American infantryman finds himself in a Korean troop train hurrying north to the front early in 1953. Thus begins a story of humor, pathos, horror, bitterness, and a chilling look at the class discrimination–whether intended or accidental–that created a warrior class of poor, uneducated men to fight a vicious enemy in a forlorn, inhospitable country. Later, this soldier’s epiphany comes from the lips of one of his beloved comrades, and creates the metaphor for much of the harrowing journey that is The Gnashing of Teeth. You will be witness to his growth, agonizing choices and painful search for redemption where little was forthcoming. Love also finds its way into this novel, beginning and ending in unlikely and sometimes heart-rending circumstances. Whether or not this soldier survives his journey is a growing concern readers will not satisfy until the very last words of this epic.

Escape from Slavery: The True Story of My Ten Years in Captivity and My Journey to Freedom in America,"Winner of the Books for a Better Life/Suze Orman First Book Award May 1986: Seven-year-old Francis Bok was selling his mother's eggs and peanuts near his village in southern Sudan when Arab raiders on horseback burst into the quiet marketplace, murdering men and gathering the women and young children into a group. Strapped to horses and donkeys, Francis and others were taken north into lives of slavery under wealthy Muslim farmers. For ten years, Francis lived in a shed near the goats and cattle that were his responsibility. After two failed attempts to flee--each bringing severe beatings and death threats--Francis finally escaped at age seventeen. He persevered through prison and refugee camps for three more years, winning the attention of United Nations officials who granted passage to America. Now a student and an antislavery activist, Francis Bok has made it his life mission to combat world slavery. His is the first voice to speak to an estimated 27 million people held against their will in nearly every nation, including our own.

The Tiger Moth story,"The Tiger Moth is one of the major aviation success stories in the history of British aviation. Developed by Geoffrey de Havilland and flown for the first time on October 26 1931, the biplane became the most important elementary trainer used by Commonwealth forces. More than 1,000 Tiger Moths were delivered before WWII, and subsequently around 4,000 were built in the UK with an extra 2,000 being manufactured in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Following the end of WWII, pilots could buy and modify a Tiger Moth for recreational use or agricultural crop spraying and use it relatively cheaply. This, combined with its popularity within the aero club movement, provided employment for the Tiger Moths until the late fifties when the more modern closed cockpit aircraft began to force them into retirement. This new paperback edition provides a comprehensive account of the aircraft origins and its development as a trainer of Commonwealth pilots in times of peace and war. It also looks at some of the other roles which this versatile little aeroplane performed such as a crop duster, glider tug, aerial advertiser, bomber, coastal patrol plane and aerial ambulance.

From Fear to Hope & Back Again,"This book is a series of reflections about the journey of mankind toward their God, whether they believe or not. It is dedicated to the struggle of all who live their lives with love for their neighbor and do the best they can with what they are given. It is further dedicated to those non-believers who live a life of goodness with real concern for their fellow man. We are all on a journey, whether we want to admit it or not. We only have so much time to accomplish what needs to be done. But in the end, only one thing matters. We are to be united with our loving God for all eternity. The bulk of the book concerns the promise that America holds for all people. In no way are the reflections intended to belittle any group that is true and honest in their efforts to help its followers achieve the goal of unity with God. The intention of the author is to provide some insight to the problems we face as a people. The problems are many, but first and foremost we must have the same interests for others that we have for ourselves. All of the problems we face have the same root. Thus far in our civilizations we have had much education and instruction. Much of this knowledge has lead to misunderstanding and has not addressed the root of our problems. The root is that we are not capable to love others as we love ourselves. If we do not address the root of the problem, then we will not be better off tomorrow than we are today or were yesterday. ‘NOTHING WILL CHANGE FOR THE BETTER’.",['Vicktor Barrios'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vaYda8s4MbEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=vaYda8s4MbEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=From+Fear+to+Hope&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Author House,2012-01-18,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vaYda8s4MbEC&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],
The Works of George Berkeley (Major works),"The eighteenth century Irish philosopher George Berkeley is best known for his empiricist and idealist philosophy, which argues that reality consists only of minds and their ideas. He is also known for his critique of abstraction, an important premise in his argument for immaterialism. His chief philosophical work, ‘A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge’ (1710), largely seeks to refute the claims made by Berkeley's contemporary John Locke about the nature of human perception.

Anthology of American Folk Music,"Released in 1952, The Anthology of American Folk Music was the singular vision of the enigmatic artist, musicologist, and collector Harry Smith (1923–1991). A collection of eighty-four commercial recordings of American vernacular and folk music originally issued between 1927 and 1932, the Anthology featured an eclectic and idiosyncratic mixture of blues and hillbilly songs, ballads old and new, dance music, gospel, and numerous other performances less easy to classify. Where previous collections of folk music, both printed and recorded, had privileged field recordings and oral transmission, Smith purposefully shaped his collection from previously released commercial records, pointedly blurring established racial boundaries in his selection and organisation of performances. Indeed, more than just a ground-breaking collection of old recordings, the Anthology was itself a kind of performance on the part of its creator. Over the six decades of its existence, however, it has continued to exert considerable influence on generations of musicians, artists, and writers. It has been credited with inspiring the North American folk revival—""The Anthology was our bible"", asserted Dave Van Ronk in 1991, ""We all knew every word of every song on it""—and with profoundly influencing Bob Dylan. After its 1997 release on CD by Smithsonian Folkways, it came to be closely associated with the so-called Americana and Alt-Country movements of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Following its sixtieth birthday, and now available as a digital download and rereleased on vinyl, it is once again a prominent icon in numerous musical currents and popular culture more generally. This is the first book devoted to such a vital piece of the large and complex story of American music and its enduring value in American life. Reflecting the intrinsic interdisciplinarity of Smith’s original project, this collection contains a variety of new perspectives on all aspects of the Anthology.","['Ross Hair', 'Thomas Ruys Smith']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u2GuDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=u2GuDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Anthology+of+American+Folk+Music&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2016-12-08,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=u2GuDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Music'],

Treasures of Gilcrease: Selections from the Permanent Collection,"In 1938, Thomas Gilcrease, a native of Tulsa, Oklahoma, opened the first museum devoted to the art of the American West. A true visionary, Gilcrease was ahead of his time in understanding the importance of America’s own heritage. His passion for art and history, his Native American ancestry, and his oil revenues coincided in a rare alignment. His legacy is an astounding collection of paintings, sculptures, artifacts, rare books, and documents. This lavishly produced book, featuring nearly two hundred color reproductions, tells the story of Gilcrease and of the renowned museum that bears his name. Compiled by the museum’s curators, Treasures of Gilcrease exemplifies the beauty and breadth of the museum’s resources. The fine art collection alone boasts more than 10,000 American works, ranging in styles from classical to romantic to impressionist and by such master artists as George Catlin, Charles M. Russell, Thomas Moran, and Frederic Remington. The works by Native artists also span styles ranging from painted hides to twentieth-century flat-style. The artifacts—300,000-plus pieces housed in the galleries and vaults—include ceramics, clothing, pipes, and objects of utility, ceremony, and ornamentation. The archives collection contains some 100,000 manuscripts, books, photographs, maps, imprints, and broadsides. Treasures of Gilcrease offers a vivid and engaging tour through these collections in the company of the experts who know them best.","['Anne Morand', 'Daniel C.

Drug War Driving Lessons covers DUI's and drugged driving; also learn how to make your phone call from jail count, how to ace your bail hearing, and protect your Internet privacy.

Helter Skelter,"THE BEST-SELLING TRUE CRIME BOOK IN HISTORY ______________________ The shocking true story of the Manson murders, revealed in this harrowing, often terrifying book.

What made these young men and women kill again and again with no trace of remorse? Did the murders continue even after Manson's imprisonment?

A member of the prominent Sinkler family of Charleston and Philadelphia, Elizabeth ""Lizzie"" Sinkler married into Philadelphia's wealthy Coxe family in 1870. Widowed just three years later, she dedicated herself to a lifelong pursuit of philanthropy, intellectual endeavor, and extensive travel. Heeding the call of their dauntless adventuresome spirits, Lizzie and her son, Eckley, set sail in 1890 on a series of odysseys that took them from the United States to Cairo, Luxor, Khartoum, Algiers, Istanbul, Naples, Vichy, and Athens. The Coxes not only visited the sites and monuments of ancient civilizations but also participated in digs, funded entire expeditions, and ultimately subsidized the creation of the Coxe Wing of Ancient History at the University of Pennsylvania Museum. A prolific correspondent, Lizzie conscientiously recorded her adventures abroad in lively prose that captures the surreal exhilarations and harsh realities of traversing the known and barely known worlds of Africa and the Middle East. She journeyed through foreign lands with various nieces in tow to expose them to the educational and social benefits of the Grand Tour.

War of the Werewolf,"Militant extremists from opposite ends of the political spectrum have radical plans to change America, and they are not above taking innocent life to achieve their goals. But, each faction stands in the way of the other and each plans to eliminate the opposition. Mischievous fate, however, has dealt both factions a wild card and one of the leaders may have to commit suicide to stop an even greater evil from arising. The decision must be made before the coming eclipse of the Harvest Moon, unless Ludwig Von Dracula, claiming descent from his infamous namesake, can find a solution to stop the bloodshed. The action builds towards a twisting set of plot turns and shifting fortunes as various actors review their moral options and ethical obligations. A rollicking thriller that combines the traditional werewolf/vampire horror story with the political suspense novel, War of the Werewolf challenges the reader to rethink many cherished principles about right and wrong, good and evil. On the surface, it tells of the conflict between two violent radicals from opposite ends of the political spectrum. As the reader digs deeper, the story turns on decisions about making ethical choices involving life and death. How far will you go to stop a great evil from occurring? Would you willingly take innocent life to promote a socially just revolution? Would you sacrifice your own life for the greater good? Or, would you step aside and let matters take their natural course while you watch from a safe and distant vantage point? These are choices confronting several characters in the story. A fundamental question facing the reader is whom to root for and whom to despise. Who are the heroes and who are the villains? Where you stand on the political spectrum may effect your initial decisions, but as the story reveals more of the characters' actions and motives, you may find your allegiances fading or shifting. Major and secondary characters in this novel include: Alex Mallum, a left-wing radical, who believes that a right-wing media conspiracy distracts viewers from serious discussion of widespread social injustice. He had been married to Danielle Dante, the beautiful feminist writer. When she divorced him under humiliating circumstances, his life fell apart. On the run from the law and from a vicious California mobster, he stopped overnight at the Pentagram Pub, where sick with fever he believed he was attacked by a raging she-beast. Ever since that night he has suffered frequent blackouts and strange dreams about stalking wolves. Subsequently he went underground in New York where he fell in with CRUSH, a hapless band of wannabe urban terrorists seeking publicity through violence. When he learns that Danielle plans to marry Luke Fenris, the multimillionaire who symbolizes everything Mallum hates about America, he knows what CRUSH’s next mission will be. Then he learns what Fenris is really up to. Luke Fenris, a reclusive right-wing multi-millionaire who hates the Welfare State. Despite intensive journalistic investigation, his past remains a deep mystery. Although few know much about him, he has captured the public imagination as a can-do leader who many want to see run for President. He believes a left-wing media conspiracy wants to destroy individual freedom and turn America into a socialist state. Despite disappearing for weeks at a time, only to reappear for just a couple of days each month, he has brought together several influential co-conspirators to change the way America works. And that’s only the first stage of his plan. Ludwig Von Dracula, head of the Vampire Liberation Front and award-winning advertising copywriter, who has befriended Mallum. Dracula claims to be a descendant of his infamous namesake and tells Mallum the dangerous secret behind that strange night at the Pentagram Pub. He also tells Mallum that there is only one way to stop Fenris, but Mallum doesn’t like what he hears.

"Robert Frost: Collected Poems, Prose, and Plays (Library of America)","Justly celebrated at home and abroad, Robert Frost is perhaps America’s greatest twentieth-century poet and a towering figure in American letters. From the publication of his first collections, A Boy’s Will (1913) and North of Boston (1914), Frost was recognized as a poet of unique power and formal skill, and the enduring significance of his work has been acknowledged by each subsequent generation. His poetry ranges from deceptively simply pastoral lyrics and genial, vernacular genre pieces to darker meditations, complex and ironic. Here, based on extensive research into his manuscripts and published work, is the first authoritative and truly comprehensive collection of his writings. Brought together for the first time in a Library of America single volume is all the major poetry, a generous selection of uncollected poems, all of Frost’s dramatic writing, and the most extensive gathering of his prose writings ever published, several of which are printed here for the first time. The core of this collection is the 1949 Complete Poems of Robert Frost, the last collection supervised by Frost himself. This version of the poems is free of unauthorized editorial changes introduced into subsequent editions. Also included is In the Clearing (1962), Frost’s final volume of poetry. Verse drawn from letters, articles, pamphlets, and journals makes up the largest selection of uncollected poems ever assembled, including nearly two dozen beautiful early works printed for the first time. Also gathered here are all the dramatic works: three plays and two verse masques. The unprecedented prose section includes more than three times as many items as any other collection available. It is rich and diverse, presenting many newly discovered or rediscovered pieces. Especially unusual items include Frost’s contribution to John F. Kennedy’s inauguration and two fascinating 1959 essays on “The Future of Man.” Several manuscript items are published here for the first time, including the essays “‘Caveat Poeta’” and “The Way There,” Frost’s remarks on being appointed poetry consultant to the Library of Congress in 1958, the preface to a proposed new edition of North of Boston, and many others. A selection of letters represents all of Frost’s important comments about prosody, poetics, style, and his theory of “sentence sounds.” LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation’s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America’s best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries.",['Robert Frost'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pahNEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=pahNEAAAQBAJ&dq=Robert+Frost:+Collected+Poems,+Prose,+and+Plays+(Library+of+America)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Library of America,1995-10-01,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=pahNEAAAQBAJ&dq=Robert+Frost:+Collected+Poems,+Prose,+and+Plays+(Library+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Poetry'],

The east in the light of the west: The children of Lucifer and the brothers of Christ,"‘A wonderfully beautiful legend tells us that when Lucifer fell from heaven to earth a precious stone fell from his crown… This precious stone is in a certain respect nothing else than the full power of the “I”.’ Seven years after staging Edward Schuré’s drama The Children of Lucifer, Rudolf Steiner felt able to talk openly about the complex relationship between the beings of Lucifer and Christ. In an extraordinary series of lectures, Steiner addresses the difficult and often misunderstood subject of Lucifer’s role in human development. Speaking within the broader context of ancient and modern – Eastern and Western – spiritual teachings, Steiner clarifies that Lucifer is not the simple caricature of evil that many imagine, but rather plays a pivotal role in human development. Whilst Rudolf Steiner held a deep respect for Eastern philosophy, he worked consistently from his personal knowledge of the Western – Christian – esoteric tradition. At a time when many of his colleagues revered ancient Eastern texts, Steiner viewed these same documents as representations of an earlier stage of human consciousness; as evidence of the heights that Eastern wisdom had reached, thousands of years before the development of Western science and culture. But Steiner maintains that the ancient truths need to be understood in the context of contemporary knowledge: that the old wisdom of the East has to be seen in the light of the West. Chapters include: Eternity and Time – Comparison of the Wisdom of East and West – The Nature of the Physical and the Astral Worlds – Evolutionary Stages – The Children of Lucifer and the Brothers of Christ – Lucifer and Christ – The Nature of the Luciferic Influence in History – The Bodhisattvas and the Christ.",['Rudolf Steiner'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nec4DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=nec4DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+east+in+the+light+of+the+west:+The+children+of+Lucifer+and+the+brothers+of+Christ&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Rudolf Steiner Press,2017-10-23,http://books.google.nl/books?id=nec4DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+east+in+the+light+of+the+west:+The+children+of+Lucifer+and+the+brothers+of+Christ&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Anthroposophy'],

Artificial Intelligence,"No recent scientific enterprise has been so alluring, terrifying, and filled with extravagant promise and frustrating setbacks as artificial intelligence. How intelligent are the best of today's AI programs? To what extent can we entrust them with decisions that affect our lives? How human-like do we expect them to become, and how soon do we need to worry about them surpassing us in most, if not all, human endeavours? From leading AI researcher and award-winning author Melanie Mitchell comes a knowledgeable and captivating account of modern-day artificial intelligence. Flavoured with personal stories and a twist of humor, Artificial Intelligence illuminates the workings of machines that mimic human learning, perception, language, creativity and common sense. Weaving together advances in AI with cognitive science and philosophy, Mitchell probes the extent to which today's 'smart' machines can actually think or understand, and whether AI requires such elusive human qualities in order to be reliable, trustworthy and beneficial.

"Salem Possessed, The Social Origins of Witchcraft","Tormented girls writhing in agony, stern judges meting out harsh verdicts, nineteen bodies swinging on Gallows Hill. The stark immediacy of what happened in 1692 has obscured the complex web of human passion which climaxed in the Salem witch trials From rich and varied sources—many neglected and unknown—Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum give us a picture of the people and events more intricate and more fascinating than any other in the massive literature. It is a story of powerful and deeply divided families and of a community determined to establish an independent identity—beset by restraints and opposition from without and factional conflicts from within—and a minister whose obsessions helped to bring this volatile mix to the flash point. Not simply a dramatic and isolated event, the Salem outbreak has wider implications for our understanding of developments central to the American experience: the disintegration of Puritanism, the pressures of land and population in New England towns, the problems besetting farmer and householder, the shifting role of the church, and the powerful impact of commercial capitalism.",['Paul Boyer'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FIRtMQabjJ4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FIRtMQabjJ4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Salem+Possessed,+The+Social+Origins+of+Witchcraft&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Harvard University Press,1976-01-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FIRtMQabjJ4C&source=gbs_api,['History'],4.0

Ben Holladay: The Stagecoach King,"The red and black Concord stagecoaches that crossed the West in the 1860s, known to the Indians as ""fire boxes,"" have been celebrated in Mark Twain's fiction and JohnøFord's films. Predating the transcontinental railroads, they provided vital lines of communication to the East during the Civil War and opened to development the newly settled regions beyond the Missouri River. From 1862 to 1866 Ben Holladay owned and operated a network of stagecoach lines from Kansas to California, the main one following the central mail route between Atchison and Salt Lake City established by the U.S. government in 1848, and other lines branching into the mining country of California and Montana and Idaho territories. In spite of bad weather, primitive roads, holdups by highwaymen, and trouble with Indians, Holladay's coaches delivered passengers and mail on schedule. J. V. Frederick describes in fascinating detail the organization and operation of a vast transportation empire ruled by a man with executive genius and a gambler's instincts. Although Holladay forbade drinking and profanity on the job, he commanded the loyalty of his drivers, whom he dressed in broad-brimmed sombreros, corduroys trimmed with velvet, and high-heeled boots. He sold out just before the Union Pacific Railroad was completed and until his death in 1887 remained popular with Americans, who named racehorses and cigars after him.",['J. V.

Science of the Gods,"A paradigm-shifting blend of science, religion, and philosophy for agnostic, spiritual-but-not-religious, and scientifically minded readers Many people are fed up with the way traditional religion alienates them: too easily it can perpetuate conflict, vilify science, and undermine reason. Nancy Abrams, a philosopher of science, lawyer, and lifelong atheist, is among them. And yet, when she turned to the recovery community to face a personal struggle, she found that imagining a higher power gave her a new freedom. Intellectually, this was quite surprising. Meanwhile her husband, famed astrophysicist Joel Primack, was helping create a new theory of the universe based on dark matter and dark energy, and Abrams was collaborating with him on two books that put the new scientific picture into a social and political context. She wondered, “Could anything actually exist in this strange new universe that is worthy of the name ‘God?’” In A God That Could Be Real, Abrams explores a radically new way of thinking about God. She dismantles several common assumptions about God and shows why an omniscient, omnipotent God that created the universe and plans what happens is incompatible with science—but that this doesn’t preclude a God that can comfort and empower us. Moving away from traditional arguments for God, Abrams finds something worthy of the name “God” in the new science of emergence: just as a complex ant hill emerges from the collective behavior of individually clueless ants, and just as the global economy emerges from the interactions of billions of individuals’ choices, God, she argues, is an “emergent phenomenon” that arises from the staggering complexity of humanity’s collective aspirations and is in dialogue with every individual. This God did not create the universe—it created the meaning of the universe. It’s not universal—it’s planetary. It can’t change the world, but it helps us change the world. A God that could be real, Abrams shows us, is what humanity needs to inspire us to collectively cooperate to protect our warming planet and create a long-term civilization.",['Nancy Ellen Abrams'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cQVoBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=cQVoBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Science+of+the+Gods&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Beacon Press,2015-03-10,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cQVoBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],13.0

The World We Live In,"Do you ever wonder why the world is the way it is? The World We Live In: Introduction through Intuition takes you on the journey in one man's eyes, in two parts. Part one takes you through different aspects of life and shows how anyone can spark this higher state of consciousness through their own intuition. Part two opens your eyes to how different aspects of life and things from or not from this world try to keep us from this conscious state. Once we all learn how to rise out of the physical and into the spiritual of consciousness, then we see the world in a whole new manner. You can put a connection on conspiracy, religion, government, and many other aspects and see how they all come together to keep the common ""agenda.""

The Great Divide: The Rocky Mountains in the American Mind,"More than any other American landscape, the Rocky Mountains have prompted a remarkable medley of fierce, poetic dreams. For some 150 years this region served as a landscape of freedom for the black sheep of our culture: from the rebellious sons of wealthy industrialists to African American trappers; from affluent young women struggling for suffrage to the hippies of the 1960s, determined to turn their backs on the establishment. Gary Ferguson spins magnificent tales about these vivid charactersblazing a trail that leads us finally to modern adventure travelers bedecked in high-tech outerwear and toting satellite phones into the wild. From this spot on the crest of the continent comes a fresh look at how the nation's wild lands inspired some of our most cherished notions of freedom, as well as how much we stand to lose should our connections to those lands drift out of reach. 25 black & white photos, index.",['Gary Ferguson'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=trvXVsaDG7gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=trvXVsaDG7gC&dq=The+Great+Divide:+The+Rocky+Mountains+in+the+American+Mind&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,W.

"Classic American Popular Song: The Second Half-Century, 1950-2000","During the so-called ""Age of Melancholy,"" many writers invoked both traditional and new conceptualizations of the disease in order to account for various types of social turbulence, ranging from discontent and factionalism to civil war. Writing about melancholy became a way to explore both the causes and preventions of political disorder, on both specific and abstract levels. Thus, at one and the same moment, a writer could write about melancholy to discuss specific and ongoing political crises and to explore more generally the principles which generate political conflicts in the first place. In the course of developing a traditional discourse of melancholy of its own, English writers appropriated representations of the disease - often ineffectively - in order to account for the political turbulence during the civil war and Interregnum periods.","['David Jenness', 'Don Velsey']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Vz1kQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Vz1kQgAACAAJ&dq=Classic+American+Popular+Song:+The+Second+Half-Century,+1950-2000&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",,2006,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Vz1kQgAACAAJ&dq=Classic+American+Popular+Song:+The+Second+Half-Century,+1950-2000&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Music'],

The Shadow Of The Lion,"ADVENTURES IN AN OTHER-WORLDLY NEW-AGE VENICE it is the year 1537. The great winged Lion stares over a Venice where magic thrives. The rich Venetian Republic is a bastion of independence and tolerance. Perhaps for that reason, it is also corrupt, and rotten with intrigue. But for the young brothers Marco and Benito Valdosta, vagabond and thief, Venice is simply-home. They have no idea that they stand at the center of the city's coming struggle for its very life. They know nothing of the powerful forces moving in the background. They have barely heard of Chernobog, demonlord of the North, who is shifting his pawns to attack Venice in order to cut into the underbelly of the Holy Roman Empire. All Marco and Benito know is that they're hungry and in dangerous company: Katerina the smuggler, Caesare the sell-sword, Montagnard assassins, church inquisitors, militant Knights of the Holy Trinity, Dottore Marina the Strega mage . . . and Maria. Maria might be an honest canaler, but she had the hottest temper a boy could find. Yet among the dark waters of the canals lurk far worse dangers than a hot-tempered girl. Chernobog has set a monster loose to wreak havoc on the city. Magic, murder and evil are all at work to pull Venice down. Fanatical monks seek to root out true witchcraft with fire and sword. Steel-clad Teutonic knights, wealth traders, church dignitaries and great Princes fight and plot for control of the jewel of the Mediterranean. And somehow all of these, from thieves to mages to princes, must gather around Marco and his brother Benito, under the shadow of the great winged lion of Venice.

Sacred Beat: From the Heart of the Drum Circle,"The beat is universal -- drumming as a way of communicating with other people, spirits, and self exists around the world and throughout time. And contemporary drumming is thriving! In the neo-pagan community, the most popular festivals and workshops are those that feature drumming circles. In healing centers, nursing homes, women's centers, and schools across the country, people are forming drumming circles. Sacred Beat honors and explores every aspect of drumming -- historical, contemporary, practical. In Part I, Telesco and Waterhawk tell the history of drums and drumming circles and the myths, superstitions, and religions that have grown up around drumming. From West Africa to Tibet, from Siberia to England, from Vietnam to Apache territory, where Fox gave the people drums along with fire -- come stories about drums, their invention, their use up until contemporary times. People respond almost universally and profoundly to drums -- to relieve stress, to communicate, to move in rhythm with the universe, to praise their gods. A comprehensive section of practical information follows, with ideas for finding a drum and other rhythmic tools that are right for your vision, caring for and decorating your instrument, drum etiquette, and elements of a good drum circle. The next section of Sacred Beat is all about drumming in groups -- different ways it's being done, from Native American Pow-Wows to Goddess gatherings to community centers, and how to become a part of it. The book closes with a section on creating drumming magic all your own, with meditations, prayers, and divinations to create overall well-being and spiritual awareness with drums. The voice of the drum combines with the voice of the Ancestors, the voice of Spirit, and the voice of our own soul to create a powerful and transformational partnership. By working with the drum, a person can support this partnership, reach out to the community, touch the earth, and nurture their own spirit.","['Patricia Telesco', 'Don Waterhawk']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gy0h6TvCpU4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=gy0h6TvCpU4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sacred+Beat:+From+the+Heart+of+the+Drum+Circle&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Red Wheel,2003-06-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gy0h6TvCpU4C&source=gbs_api,['Music'],

This book, the first to place Frith's Egyptian and Levantine images in cultural context, reveals the distinct meanings these ostensibly ""topographic"" pictures held for the photographer and his Victorian audience. A Quaker by birth and an entrepreneur by nature, Frith brought to his photographic projects a sense of mission: to revive and confirm the stories of the Bible, while offering the region to armchair travelers as a seamless Oriental milieu of Romantic reverie. Francis Frith in Egypt and Palestine narrates the political, intellectual, and social concerns that make Frith representative of England's encounter with the East in the nineteenth century. Historian of photography Douglas R. Nickel brings a sophisticated interdisciplinary approach to bear on the subject in order to expose the complexity of Frith's image-making, setting the photographs against a Victorian backdrop of religious debate, imperialist thought, Romantic philosophy, and Pre-Raphaelite aesthetics.","['Douglas Robert Nickel', 'Francis Frith']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XudqQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=XudqQgAACAAJ&dq=Francis+Frith+in+Egypt+and+Palestine:+A+Victorian+Photographer+Abroad&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2004-01,http://books.google.nl/books?id=XudqQgAACAAJ&dq=Francis+Frith+in+Egypt+and+Palestine:+A+Victorian+Photographer+Abroad&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Photography'],

Chopin ;: The man and his music,"Frederic Chopin (1810 - 1849) was one of the most influential musicians of the 19th Century. Discovered as a child-prodigy pianist in his native Poland, he later travelled to France, where he remained after the Polish uprising of 1830-31. There he gave few public performances, but worked as composer and piano teacher. He later became a French citizen and conducted a stormy relationship with French writer George Sand (Aurore Dudevant). He died at 39 of pulmonary tuberculosis. Chopin innovated many traditional forms of piano music and also created new forms such as the ballade. Though technically demanding, his music is nuanced and deeply expressive. His mazurkas and polonaises became the centerpiece of Polish classical music.",['James Huneker'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7YECppxCp1UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=7YECppxCp1UC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Chopin+%3B:+The+man+and+his+music&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,The Floating Press,2009-01-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7YECppxCp1UC&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],

The Maritime History of the World **Volumes 1 & 2**,"The first volume of The Cambridge History of America and the World examines how the United States emerged out of a series of colonial interactions, some involving indigenous empires and communities that were already present when the first Europeans reached the Americas, others the adventurers and settlers dispatched by Europe's imperial powers to secure their American claims, and still others men and women brought as slaves or indentured servants to the colonies that European settlers founded. Collecting the thoughts of dynamic scholars working in the fields of early American, Atlantic, and global history, the volume presents an unrivalled portrait of the human richness and global connectedness of early modern America. Essay topics include exploration and environment, conquest and commerce, enslavement and emigration, dispossession and endurance, empire and independence, new forms of law and new forms of worship, and the creation and destruction when the peoples of four continents met in the Americas.","['Eliga Gould', 'Paul Mapp', 'Carla Gardina Pestana']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bvBeEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=bvBeEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT172&dq=The+Maritime+History+of+the+World+**Volumes+1&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Cambridge University Press,2021-11-30,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bvBeEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],
Legends of the Iroquois (Myths and Legends),"THESE 24 Iroquois legends and stories have been told in the homes of the Iroquois for many centuries; long before the white man arrived on the North American continent. The perusal and study of these stories will, it is believed, give as much pleasure to the reader, as they have given the compiler. Of special interest is the “Legend of Hiawatha” made famous fifty years earlier by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Some of the stories and lengends in this volume are: The Birth of the Arbutus A Legend Of The River Legends Of The Corn The First Winter The Great Mosquito The Story Of Oniata The Legends of Hiawatha, and many, many more. The American Indians, like so many cultures, built neither monuments nor wrote books. However, they did make picture writings, known in later years as “wampum.” Mostly, these were mere symbols, recording mainly feats of arms. However, the Iroquois used wampum as a record of a person’s credentials or a certificate of authority. It was also used for official purposes and religious ceremonies, and it was used as a way to bind peace between tribes. Among the Iroquois, every chief and every clan mother has a certain string of wampum that serves as their certificate of office. When they pass on or are removed from their station, the string will then pass on to the new leader. Runners carrying messages during colonial times would present the wampum showing that they had the authority to carry the message. Wampum is still used to this day by the Iroquois in the ceremony of raising up a new chief and in the Iroquois Thanksgiving ceremonies. If the American forefathers had taken more interest in the peoples they found on the Western Continent, spending less of their energies in devising plans for cheating the Indians out of their furs and lands—a policy their descendants have closely followed and admirably succeeded in—our libraries might contain volumes of fairy tales that would delight the youth of many generations. =========== KEYWORDS/TAGS: Legends of the Iroquois, Aliquipiso, American Indian, american indian ancestry, American Indian books, American Indian childrens books, american indian east coast, american indian Iroquois, american Indian legends, american indian songs, american indian stories, american indian tales, american indian traditions, american indian tribes, american indian values, american indian warriors, american indian words, animals, Arbutus, arrows, Ash Tree, assemble, Authority, beads, bear, beautiful, beaver, bedtime stories, birds, Birth, brave, Buzzard's Covering, canoe, chief, children, childrens books, childrens stories, Confederation, corn, Cornplanter, council, council fire, dead, death, death song, eagle, earth spirits, evil, fables, fairy tales, First Winter, Flying Head, folklore, Folk-Lore, forest, fox, Gift, Great, Great Mosquito, happiness, Happy, Healing Waters, heart, Hiawatha, horse, Hunter, Hunting Grounds, Indians, Iroquois, Kanistagia, lakes, Legend of the River, legends, Legends of the Corn, lodge, lover, maiden, Manito, medicine, men, Message Bearers, Mirror in the Water, Mohawk, mountains, myths, Native American, Nekumonta, Oneida, Oniata, Onondagas, Origin, Orontadeka, panther, papoose, peace, Peacemaker, pipe, raccoon, river, sachem, sacred, Sacred Stone, Sacrifice, Seneca, Shanewis, Spirit, stories, streams, summer, sun, Tiogaughwa, trail, trees, Turtle Clan, Unwelcome Visitor, village, Violet, wampum, warriors, waters, white men, Why Animals do not Talk, wigwam, wild, wisdom, Wise Sachem, wolf, woods, young people",['Anon E.

The life of David,"Part of the Jewish Encounter series Poet, warrior, and king, David has loomed large in myth and legend through the centuries, and he continues to haunt our collective imagination, his flaws and inconsistencies making him the most approachable of biblical heroes. Robert Pinsky, former poet laureate of the United States, plumbs the depths of David’s life: his triumphs and his failures, his charm and his cruelty, his divine destiny and his human humiliations. Drawing on the biblical chronicle of David’s life as well as on the later commentaries and the Psalms—traditionally considered to be David’s own words—Pinsky teases apart the many strands of David’s story and reweaves them into a glorious narrative. Under the clarifying and captivating light of Pinsky’s erudition and imagination, and his mastery of image and expression, King David—both the man and the idea of the man—is brought brilliantly to life.",['Robert Pinsky'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WGvqiDGSRS0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=WGvqiDGSRS0C&pg=PA152&dq=The+life+of+David&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Schocken,2005-09-06,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WGvqiDGSRS0C&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],1.0

Fire and Ice: Two Deadly Disasters (Fire at Peshtigo; Shipwreck on Lake Michigan),"“Lighthouses are a reflection of the human spirit and a mirror to our past.”—from the Introduction No symbol is more synonymous with Wisconsin’s rich maritime traditions than the lighthouse. These historic beacons conjure myriad notions of a bygone era: romance, loneliness, and dependability; dedicated keepers manning the lights; eerie tales of haunted structures and ghosts of past keepers; mariners of yesteryear anxiously hoping to make safe haven around rocky shorelines. If these sentinels could talk, imagine the tales they would tell of ferocious Great Lakes storms taking their toll on vessels and people alike. In this fully updated edition of Wisconsin Lighthouses, Ken and Barb Wardius tell those tales, taking readers on an intimate tour of lighthouses on Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, and Lake Winnebago. Both delightful storytellers and accomplished photographers, the couple complement their engaging text with more than 100 stunning color photographs, along with dozens of archival photos, maps, documents, and artifacts. Detailed “how to get there” directions, up-to-the-minute status reports on each light, and sidebars on everything from lighthouse vocabulary to the often lonely lives of lightkeepers make this the definitive book on Wisconsin’s lighthouses.","['Ken Wardius', 'Barb Wardius']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iVecpMd_5AAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=iVecpMd_5AAC&pg=PA195&dq=Fire+and+Ice:+Two+Deadly+Disasters+(Fire+at+Peshtigo%3B+Shipwreck+on+Lake+Michigan)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Wisconsin Historical Society,2013-10-17,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iVecpMd_5AAC&source=gbs_api,['History'],1.0

Others have broken rules, missed deadlines, failed to live up to commitments, or just plain behaved badly--and nobody steps up to the issue. Or they do, but do a lousy job and create a whole new set of problems. Accountability suffers and new problems spring up. New research demonstrates that these disappointments aren't just irritating, they're costly--sapping organizational performance by twenty to fifty percent and accounting for up to ninety percent of divorces. Crucial Confrontations teaches skills drawn from 10,000 hours of real-life observations to increase confidence in facing issues like: An employee speaks to you in an insulting tone that crosses the line between sarcasm and insubordination. Now what? Your boss just committed you to a deadline you know you can't meet--and not-so-subtly hinted he doesn't want to hear complaints about it. Your son walks through the door sporting colorful new body art that raises your blood pressure by forty points. Speak now, pay later. An accountant wonders how to step up to a client who is violating the law. Can you spell unemployment? Family members fret over how to tell granddad that he should no longer drive his car. This is going to get ugly. A nurse worries about what to say to an abusive physician. She quickly remembers ""how things work around here"" and decides not to say anything. Everyone knows how to run for cover, or if adequately provoked, step up to these confrontations in a way that causes a real ruckus. That we have down pat. Crucial Confrontations teaches you how to deal with violated expectations in a way that solves the problem at hand, and doesn't harm the relationship--and in fact, even strengthens it. Crucial Confrontations borrows from twenty years of research involving two groups. More than 25,000 people helped the authors identify those who were most influential during crucial confrontations. They spent 10,000 hours watching these people, documented what they saw, and then trained and tested with more than 300,000 people. Second, they measured the impact of crucial confrontations improvements on organizational and team performance--the results were immediate and sustainable: twenty to fifty percent improvements in measurable performance.","['Kerry Patterson', 'Joseph Grenny', 'Ron McMillan', 'Al Switzler']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=I1oOcpvsmOkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=I1oOcpvsmOkC&q=Crucial+Confrontations&dq=Crucial+Confrontations&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,McGraw Hill Professional,2004-08-26,http://books.google.nl/books?id=I1oOcpvsmOkC&dq=Crucial+Confrontations&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],4.0
Wellfleet: A Cape Cod Village (MA) (Images of America) (Images of America (Arcadia Publishing)),"When Pres. John F. Kennedy established the Cape Cod National Seashore in 1961, it was acclaimed as the ""finest victory ever recorded for the cause of conservation in New England."" When erosion and overdevelopment threatened the Cape, the idea of a national seashore took hold, forever protecting this treasured place. The park preserves 44,000 acres of forest, marsh, bog, and ponds, and a 40-mile stretch from Provincetown to Chatham, which Henry David Thoreau called the ""Great Beach."" Unlike other national parks at the time, the Cape Cod National Seashore was created from a combination of private, town, state, and federal lands. Cape Cod National Seashore: The First 50 Years captures the political drama of the creation of this extraordinary seashore. Images detail an early Native American presence and the romance of whaling, shipwrecks, lighthouses, windmills, and dune shacks.",['Daniel Lombardo'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pMUFlCq2JtAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=pMUFlCq2JtAC&pg=PT3&dq=Wellfleet:+A+Cape+Cod+Village+(MA)+(Images+of+America)+(Images+of+America+(Arcadia+Publishing))&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Arcadia Publishing,2010,http://books.google.nl/books?id=pMUFlCq2JtAC&dq=Wellfleet:+A+Cape+Cod+Village+(MA)+(Images+of+America)+(Images+of+America+(Arcadia+Publishing))&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],

"Woman at the window, a novel","Instant #1 New York Times Bestseller! For readers of Gillian Flynn and Tana French comes one of the decade’s most anticipated debuts, to be published in thirty-six languages around the world and already in development as a major film from Fox: a twisty, powerful Hitchcockian thriller about an agoraphobic woman who believes she witnessed a crime in a neighboring house. It isn’t paranoia if it’s really happening . . . Anna Fox lives alone—a recluse in her New York City home, unable to venture outside. She spends her day drinking wine (maybe too much), watching old movies, recalling happier times . . . and spying on her neighbors. Then the Russells move into the house across the way: a father, mother, their teenaged son. The perfect family. But when Anna, gazing out her window one night, sees something she shouldn’t, her world begins to crumble and its shocking secrets are laid bare. What is real? What is imagined? Who is in danger? Who is in control? In this diabolically gripping thriller, no one—and nothing—is what it seems. Twisty and powerful, ingenious and moving, The Woman in the Window is a smart, sophisticated novel of psychological suspense that recalls the best of Hitchcock.",['A. J.

Een leven waarin Astrid Holleeder het heft in eigen hand neemt, en kiest voor de liefde en niet voor de haat. In Familiegeheimen vertelt Astrid Holleeder openhartig en meeslepend over het leven dat zij en de andere leden van de familie - moeder Stien, dochter Miljuschka, zus Sonja en haar kinderen Richie en Francis - leiden, voor en tijdens het proces tegen Willem Holleeder. Maar vooral is er ruimte om na te denken over een leven daarna. Hoe neem je afscheid van een gezinslid? Hoe leef je met gevoelens van schuld, angst en verraad; hoe verhoud je je in een nieuwe gezinsformatie tot elkaar en tot de buitenwereld, en hoe kijk je naar de toekomst? In gesprekken met haar therapeute geeft Astrid Holleeder volledige openheid over haar diepste zielenroerselen, en zijn we getuige van de hernieuwde band met haar dochter Miljuschka, over wie ze nog niet eerder schreef.

A Fly in the Soup: Memoirs (Poets on Poetry),"A Fly in the Soup is a book of memoirs. Charles Simic was born in 1938 in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and spent his childhood in a city bombed by the Nazis in 1941 and then by the Allies in 1944. He was jailed with his mother after the war for trying to flee what was by then a communist country. He managed to emigrate in 1953, first to Paris and then a year later to the United States. He lived in New York, completed his high school education in Chicago and began writing in English and publishing his first poems in 1959 when he was twenty-one years old. The book collects pieces written on such diverse subjects as memory, history, the bombing of cities, cuisine, philosophy, life in the army, movies, and growing up in wartime. Arranged chronologically, they make an unusual memoir of exile and refugee life, a collage of stories, anecdotes, meditations and poetic fragments from one of the most barbaric periods of the last century. This is a story of a young man whose travel agents were Hitler and Stalin--the autobiography of the early years of one of the most respected contemporary American poets.

Rambo 3,"The most dangerous man in the world is back.

In this further adventure, Rambo is in exile far from home in Thailand, vowing to renounce violence and war. When his country calls him once again, he refuses to accept. But then he learns that his former commanding officer, Colonel Trautman, the only man he trusts, has been captured by the Soviets on the Afghan border during a mission that Rambo rejected. For Rambo, it’s a call to arms—and a mission back into hell. This novelization and the film have many differences.

By Any Other Name,"Is that a weed? This question, asked by anyone who has ever gardened or mowed a lawn, does not have an easy answer. After all, a weed, as suburban mother and professional weed scientist Nancy Gift reminds readers, is simply a plant out of place. In A Weed by Any Other Name, Gift offers a personal, unapologetic defense of clovers, dandelions, plantains, and more, chronicling her experience with these ""enemy"" plants season by season. Rather than falling prey to pressures to achieve the perfect lawn and garden, Gift elucidates the many reasons to embrace an unconventional, weedy yard. She celebrates the spots of wildness that crop up in various corners of suburbia, redeeming many a plant's reputation by expounding on its positive qualities.

The interpretation of dreams,"“The interpretation of dreams is the via regia to a knowledge of the unconscious element in our physical life.”—Sigmund Freud Freud’s discovery that the dream is the means by which the unconscious can be explored is undoubtedly the most revolutionary step forward in the entire history of psychology. Dreams, according to his theory, represent the hidden fulfillment of our unconscious wishes. Through them the inhibitions are released and tensions relaxed. The ability to interpret these manifestations of conflict in the human psyche opened a vast new realm of investigation, particularly invaluable in the treatment of neuroses. By his pioneer investigations into the world of dreams, Sigmund Freud created a transformation in our generation’s thinking. The Interpretation of Dreams is offered here in the translation by Dr. A. A. Brill, who for almost forty years was the translator and standard-bearer of Freudian theories in America.",['Sigmund Freud'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=k1h-AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=k1h-AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+interpretation+of+dreams&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Modern Library,2014-01-22,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=k1h-AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Psychology'],375.0
Intergenerational Communication Across the Life Span (Routledge Communication Series),"Individuals of all ages interact with one another, and their interactions have significance throughout their lives. This distinctive volume acknowledges the importance of these interactions and provides a life-span developmental view of communication and aging, attempting to capture the many similarities and changes that occur in people's lives as they age. The authors move the study of intergenerational contact closer to the actual participants, examining what happens within intergenerational interactions and how people evaluate their intergenerational experiences. The volume concentrates on the micro-context of the intergenerational interaction and the cognitions, language, and relationship behaviors related to intergenerational communication across the life span. The volume employs the perspective that the understanding of human behavior across the life span is enhanced by studying communicative behavior in intergenerational interaction. The authors integrate research from multiple disciplines concerned with intergenerational communication, which is framed by several unique theoretical perspectives drawn from the communication discipline. As a resource for the study of intergenerational communication across the life span, this monograph offers important insights to scholars, students, and all who are involved in intergenerational communication.","['Angie Williams', 'Jon F.

My Horse and Other Stories (New American Fiction),"Stacey Levine's My Horse, her first collection of short tales, reads with such precisely turned sentences that it seems to have been written with a scalpel. The stories of My Horse range from otherworldly, opaque portraits to claustrophobic domestic studies. In the title story, the narrator has a small pet horse, whose loose skin gradually develops scabby rings and sores. With painful psycho-logic the story recounts the narrator's various and changing attitudes toward the pet, as the physical deterioration of the animal is reflected in the owner's shift from love to abuse. In ""The Hump,"" a woman finds a small growth on her body, which, while she waits for a doctor's appointment, quickly grows into a large hump that affects her entire system and her perceptions of reality. In ""Cakes,"" the narrator buys several cakes with the intention of eating them to become very ""Full."" But the sudden appearance of a dog and cat at the window so terribly upsets her that she cannot eat the cakes; as the animals remain at her window for days, she postpones her enjoyment, becoming in the end ""quite ill."" In story after story Levine returns to the impermeability of experience, of not knowing even our own bodies with any certainty. A blackened tooth or a Siamese twin become haunting metaphors for the unreasonable, unfathomable burden of existence that she conveys in wickedly enthralling prose.",['Stacey Levine'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pqIsAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=pqIsAQAAIAAJ&q=My+Horse+and+Other+Stories+(New+American+Fiction)&dq=My+Horse+and+Other+Stories+(New+American+Fiction)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Sun & Moon,1993,http://books.google.nl/books?id=pqIsAQAAIAAJ&dq=My+Horse+and+Other+Stories+(New+American+Fiction)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],

"Man of La Mancha;: A musical play,","Winner of the New York Drama Critics Award for Best Musical, 1966 ""To me the most interesting aspect of the success of Man of La Mancha is the fact that it plows squarely upstream against the prevailing current of philosophy in the theater. That current is best identified by its catch-labels--Theater of the Absurd, Black Comedy, the Theater of Cruelty--which is to say the theater of alienation, of moral anarchy and despair. To the practitioners of those philosophies Man of La Mancha must seem hopelessly naive in its espousal of illusion as man's strongest spiritual need, the most meaningful function of his imagination.

The Kings of Judah,"The book of Chronicles, the last book of the Hebrew Bible and a central historical book of the Christian Old Testament, has in recent decades gone from being “the Cinderella of biblical studies” to being one of the most researched books of the Bible. The anonymous author, often simply called “the Chronicler” by modern scholars, looks back at the old Israelite monarchy, before the Babylonian Exile, from his vantage point in the post-exilic early Second Temple Period, and attempts to “update” the older historiographies of Samuel and Kings in order to elucidate their meaning to the people of his own time. In The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah, Yigal Levin does the same for the modern reader. He offers a brand-new translation and commentary on 2 Chronicles chapters 10-36, tracing the “sacred history” of the monarchy from the division of Solomon's kingdom to the final exile and return. Each chapter is translated from the original Hebrew into an English that is both faithful to the original and easy for the modern reader to follow. Extensive footnotes provide full explanations of the translator's choices and of linguistic and literary issues, taking note of alternative versions offered by a wide array of ancient and modern versions and translations. The comprehensive commentary on each section provides historical background and explains the text both on a literary and a historical level, making full use of the most up-to-date research on the text, literature, history, geography and on the archaeological background of the biblical world. The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah is to be followed by The Chronicles of David and Solomon on 1 Chronicles 10 – 2 Chronicles 9, and then by The Chronicles of All Israel on the genealogies of 1 Chronicles 1-9 and including comprehensive essays on the book of Chronicles, its time, purposes, methods and meanings.",['Yigal Levin'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mFzyDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=mFzyDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Kings+of+Judah&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Bloomsbury Publishing,2017-02-23,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mFzyDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],

How to Write and Speak Correctly,"In the preparation of this little work the writer has kept one end in view.: To make it serviceable for those for whom it is intended, that is, for those who have neither the time nor the opportunity, the learning nor the inclination, to peruse elaborate and abstruse treatises on Rhetoric, Grammar, and Composition. To them such works are as gold enclosed in chests of steel and locked beyond power of opening. This book has no pretension about it whatever,-it is neither a Manual of Rhetoric, expatiating on the dogmas of style, nor a Grammar full of arbitrary rules and exceptions. It is merely an effort to help ordinary, everyday people to express themselves in ordinary, everyday language, in a proper manner. Some broad rules are laid down, the observance of which will enable the reader to keep within the pale of propriety in oral and written language. Many idiomatic words and expressions, peculiar to the language, have been given, besides which a number of the common mistakes and pitfalls have been placed before the reader so that he may know and avoid them.",['Joseph Devlin'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-951DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=-951DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=How+to+Write+and+Speak+Correctly&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,BoD – Books on Demand,2018-11-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-951DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],2.0

He was Sick Of their incessant cheering, irritated by their enthusiasm. He was smiling contemptuously as he watched the parade, but his face twitched nervously in the red glare of the torches. He had gathered his long cloak around him in his favorite theatrical pose, for even in his misery he was still the actor. Yet his unhappiness was real enough. His mind was numbed with fatigue and disaster. For two days he had been unable to sleep at all. Minute guns had been fired in an endless salvo Of victory, and their thunder had beaten like hammer blows against his brain until he had found himself Counting Off the seconds in order to anticipate each explosion. And through all the confusion of sounds and images came the realization that his beloved South was being crushed in defeat. That thought was with him al ways, and there was no escaping it.

One Man in His Time: The Memoirs of Serge Obolensky,"Few men lived lives larger than Serge Obolensky. Born to one of Imperial Russia's great aristocratic families, Serge had an idyllic childhood growing up at a time when his country seemed poised for an economic boom at the start of the 20th century. Coming of age at the start of the most destructive period in human history, he served as a cavalry officer on the Eastern Front of the First World War. Then, as his nation collapsed into Bolshevik tyranny, he chose to stay and fight as a guerilla for the doomed White Army. Eventually forced into exile, Serge rubbed shoulders with the elite of European society, wandering through the height of the Roaring Twenties and eventually landing in America. Swearing absolute loyalty to his newly adopted home, Obolensky embarked on a series of adventures in the world of high culture, finance, and industry, witnessing firsthand the growth of America from regional hegemon to global superpower. On the outbreak of the Second World War, Obolensky volunteered for the special forces. There he trained experimental units, developed advanced combined arms tactics, and eventually became the oldest man to complete parachute jump school. His extreme courage and skill led him to be selected for a series of seemingly-impossible assignments: first securing the peaceful capture of Sardinia with only a three-man team and later preventing the destruction of Paris's only electric power plant during the German retreat from France. All of these exploits and more are detailed in Obolensky's memoirs, One Man in His Time, now available at an affordable price for the first time in decades.",['Serge Obolensky'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2FQozgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=2FQozgEACAAJ&dq=One+Man+in+His+Time:+The+Memoirs+of+Serge+Obolensky&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Independently Published,2021-01-16,http://books.google.nl/books?id=2FQozgEACAAJ&dq=One+Man+in+His+Time:+The+Memoirs+of+Serge+Obolensky&hl=&source=gbs_api,,
Mas Que Humano/More Than Human (Spanish Edition),"An ethnohistory on the spiritual and governmental conquest of the indigenous people in colonial Mexico, Idolatry and the Construction of the Spanish Empire examines the role played by the shifting concept of idolatry in the conquest of the Americas, as well as its relation to the subsequent construction of imperial power and hegemony. Contrasting readings of evangelization plays and chronicles from the Indies and legislation and literature produced in Spain, author Mina García Soormally places theoretical analysis of state formation in Colonial Latin America within the historical context. The conquest of America was presented, in its first instances, as a virtual extension of the Reconquista, which had taken place in Spain since 711, during which Spaniards fought to build an empire based in part on religious discrimination. The fight against the “heathens” (Moors and Jews) provided the experience and mindset to practice the repression of the other, making Spain a cultural laboratory that was transported across the Atlantic Ocean. Idolatry and the Construction of the Spanish Empire is a wide-ranging explication of religious orthodoxy and unorthodoxy during Spain’s medieval and early modern period as they relate to idolatry, with analysis of events that occurred on both sides of the Atlantic. The book contributes to the growing field of transatlantic studies and explores the redefinition that took place in Europe and in the colonies.",['Mina García Soormally'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NtKGDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=NtKGDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA115&dq=Mas+Que+Humano/More+Than+Human+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,University Press of Colorado,2019-01-21,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NtKGDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Social Science'],
Penthouse March 1991,"Hector Crawford – the name remains synonymous with Australian television. The tag line ‘This has been a Crawford Production’ still resonates with generations of Australians who grew up with his cops, the Sullivan family or any of the long line of productions that flowed from his legendary company. His public façade is part of our collective memory but the man behind it, and how his passion and determination changed Australian culture forever is revealed in ‘Hector’. In this compelling account of his life Rozzi Bazzani recounts vividly how, as Crawford’s influence grew, the off screen politics employed by the TV networks and rivals to diminish his company’s power became as exciting as any of his onscreen dramas. ROZZI BAZZANI was a successful singer and studio artist for many years before she turned to writing full time. In addition to spending years of her life researching Hector and Dorothy Crawford’s lives, she co-wrote the musicals Gershwin, The Musical and The King of Corn, and hosted countless radio and TV programs. Ms Bazzani is a graduate of Melbourne University and lives in the Macedon Ranges in Victoria.

Color me healthy,"To combat the epidemic of weight gain, improve cardiovascular health, increase longevity while enhancing our quality of life, it is important to develop strategies that facilitate habitual physical activity. Preventing obesity in collaboration with communities, schools, work sites, and health care professionals is the key. Through the process of coloring and reading, the understanding of food and how our bodies form fats is further illuminated. We emphasize the role of exercise as a fundamental part of staying fit and healthy. The current consensus is that three core exercises are essential: aerobic, strength building, and flexibility training. It is undisputed that diet and exercise promote good health, productivity, and longevity. Now is the time to start. Meta-analysis, based on various types of exercise, have identified exercises that appear necessary for optimal health, especially for the increasing number of employees in sedentary, computer-based jobs. For example, simply try using “light movement,” about once per hour, to stimulate the lymphatic system and increase blood flow to the legs. Simply flex the toes and move your calves up and down. Then stand up and sit down without arm support, five to ten times, repeatedly. Follow up with deep breathing. Just ensure that the lungs are filled up completely. Then expand the stomach also to capacity. Let the air out normally and without pressure.

"God, the Devil and Me","In this unique and highly entertaining autobiography, Alf Taylor chronicles his life growing up in the infamous New Norcia Mission, north of Perth in the fifties and sixties. At once darkly humorous and achingly tragic, God, The Devil and Me tells of the life and desperation of the young children forced into the care of the Spanish Nuns and Brothers who ran the Mission. Their lives made up of varying degrees of cruelty and punishments, these children were the 'little black devils' that God and religion forgot. Written with an acerbic and brutal wit, Alf intersperses dark childhood memories with a Monty Pythonesque retelling of the Bible, in which Peter is an alcoholic and Judas is a good guy. As a child, underfed, poorly clothed and missing his family, Alf sought refuge in the library in the company of Shakespeare and Michelangelo. He writes with joy about the camaraderie of the boys, their love of sport and their own company, but also notes that many descended into despair upon leaving. Most died early. Alf Taylor is one of the 'lucky ones'.",['Alf Taylor'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GZpCzwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GZpCzwEACAAJ&dq=God,+the+Devil+and+Me&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",,2022,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GZpCzwEACAAJ&dq=God,+the+Devil+and+Me&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Aboriginal Australians'],

The Perfect Portfolio,"How the greatest thinkers in finance changed the field and how their wisdom can help investors today Is there an ideal portfolio of investment assets, one that perfectly balances risk and reward? In Pursuit of the Perfect Portfolio examines this question by profiling and interviewing ten of the most prominent figures in the finance world—Jack Bogle, Charley Ellis, Gene Fama, Marty Liebowitz, Harry Markowitz, Bob Merton, Myron Scholes, Bill Sharpe, Bob Shiller, and Jeremy Siegel. We learn about the personal and intellectual journeys of these luminaries—which include six Nobel Laureates and a trailblazer in mutual funds—and their most innovative contributions. In the process, we come to understand how the science of modern investing came to be. Each of these finance greats discusses their idea of a perfect portfolio, offering invaluable insights to today’s investors. Inspiring such monikers as the Bond Guru, Wall Street’s Wisest Man, and the Wizard of Wharton, these pioneers of investment management provide candid perspectives, both expected and surprising, on a vast array of investment topics—effective diversification, passive versus active investment, security selection and market timing, foreign versus domestic investments, derivative securities, nontraditional assets, irrational investing, and so much more. While the perfect portfolio is ultimately a moving target based on individual age and stage in life, market conditions, and short- and long-term goals, the fundamental principles for success remain constant. Aimed at novice and professional investors alike, In Pursuit of the Perfect Portfolio is a compendium of financial wisdom that no market enthusiast will want to be without.","['Andrew W.

Walt Whitman: Selected Poems 1855-1892,"A fully unexpurgated collection that restores the sexual vitality and subversive flair suppressed by Whitman himself in later editions of Leaves of Grass. A century after his death, Whitman is still celebrated as America's greatest poet. In this startling new edition of his work, Whitman biographer Gary Schmidgall presents over 200 poems in their original pristine form, in the chronological order in which they were written, with Whitman's original punctuation. Included in this volume are facsimiles of Whitman's original manuscripts, contemporary - and generally blistering - reviews of Whitman's poetry (not surprisingly Henry James hated it), and early pre-Leaves of Grass poems that return us to the physical Whitman, rejoicing - sometimes graphically - in homoerotic love. Unlike the many other available editions, all drawn from the final authorized or ""deathbed"" Leaves of Grass, this collection focuses on the exuberant poems Whitman wrote during the creative and sexual prime of his life, roughly between l853 and l860. These poems are faithfully presented as Whitman first gave them to the world - fearless, explicit and uncompromised - before he transformed himself into America's respectable, mainstream Good Gray Poet through 30 years of revision, self-censorship and suppression. Whitman admitted that his later poetry lacked the ""ecstasy of statement"" of his early verse. Revealing that ecstasy for the first time, this edition makes possible a major reappraisal of our nation first great poet.",['Walt Whitman'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EYLWAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=EYLWAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Walt+Whitman:+Selected+Poems+1855-1892&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,St. Martin's Press,2013-10-08,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EYLWAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Poetry'],4.0

The Gospel According to Allan Kardec,"In this book, Allan Kardec deals with a problem of great importance, especially taking into account the past and present relations between the Church and Spiritism. The Gospel according to Spiritism contains the explanation of the moral maxims of Christ, their concordance with Spiritism and their application to different cases of life. All the communications have been made by very high spirits, and texts due to different authors agree and integrate each other in an admirable way. It is the true interpretation of the life of Christ, his miracles, acts and parables, with an explanation and commentary of high spiritual entities, in a presentation that corrects errors and false interpretations to offer only and above all the truth. The name of Allan Kardec is famous in the world as the first codifier and therefore, practically, as the founder of the spiritualist doctrine, or rather, as he wanted to define it, of the spiritualist philosophy. It was his merit to have collected and coordinated in several volumes of great interest all the theories and principles enunciated, through various mediums, in numerous spiritist communications. At that time, spiritualism was in its infancy, and Kardec's works shed light on this new world that was opening up to man on Earth. After The Book of Spirits and The Book of Mediums, which are the foundations of spiritualism, appeared The Gospel according to Spiritism. Famous and spread all over the world, it will fully satisfy the demands and expectations of the numerous devotees and enthusiasts. Since it was written, the work has lost nothing of its topicality and validity, proving that the truth is always the same and its inspiring principles never change.",['Allan Kardec'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rENCEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=rENCEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Gospel+According+to+Allan+Kardec&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,David De Angelis,2021-09-08,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rENCEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']",

Raymond Chandler: Later Novels and Other Writings: The Lady in the Lake / The Little Sister / The Long Goodbye / Playback /Double Indemnity / Selected Essays and Letters (Library of America),"Later Novels and Other Writings begins with The Lady in the Lake (1943). Written during the war, the story takes Marlowe out of the seamy L.A. streets to the deceptive tranquility of the surrounding mountains, as the search for a businessman's missing wife expands into an elegy of loneliness and loss. The darker tone typical of Chandler's later fiction is evident in The Little Sister (1949), in which an ambitious starlet, a blackmailer, and a seemingly naive young woman from Manhattan, Kansas, are the key players in a plot that provides fuel for a bitter indictment of Hollywood and Chandler's most savage portrayal of his adopted city. The Long Goodbye (1953), his most ambitious and self-revealing novel, uncovers a more anguished resonance in the Marlowe character, in a plot that hinges on the betrayal of friendship and the compromises of middle age. Playback (1958), written originally as a screenplay, is Chandler's seventh and last novel. A special feature of this volume is Chandler's long-unavailable screenplay for the film noir classic Double Indemnity (1944), adapted from James M. Cain's novel. Supplementing the volume, and providing a more personal glimpse of Chandler's personality, are a selection of essays - including ""The Simple Art of Murder,"" in which Chandler muses on his pulp roots and on the special qualities of his hero and style - and eleven letters that range wittily and often sardonically over the worlds of writing, publishing, and filmmaking.",['Raymond Chandler'],,http://books.google.nl/books?id=0957zgEACAAJ&dq=Raymond+Chandler:+Later+Novels+and+Other+Writings:+The+Lady+in+the+Lake+/+The+Little+Sister+/+The+Long+Goodbye+/+Playback+/Double+Indemnity+/+Selected+Essays+and+Letters+(Library+of+America)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,1995,http://books.google.nl/books?id=0957zgEACAAJ&dq=Raymond+Chandler:+Later+Novels+and+Other+Writings:+The+Lady+in+the+Lake+/+The+Little+Sister+/+The+Long+Goodbye+/+Playback+/Double+Indemnity+/+Selected+Essays+and+Letters+(Library+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api,"['Detective and mystery stories, American']",3.0
"Yoruba Ritual: Performers, Play, Agency","Yoruba peoples of southwestern Nigeria conceive of rituals as journeys -- sometimes actual, sometimes virtual. Performed as a parade or a procession, a pilgrimage, a masking display, or possession trance, the journey evokes the reflexive, progressive, transformative experience of ritual participation. Yoruba Ritual is an original and provocative study of these practices. Using a performance paradigm, Margaret Thompson Drewal forges a new theoretical and methodological approach to the study of ritual that is thoroughly grounded in close analysis of the thoughts and actions of the participants. Challenging traditional notions of ritual as rigid, stereotypic, and invariant, Drewal reveals ritual to be progressive, transformative, generative, and reflexive and replete with simultaneity, multifocality, contingency, indeterminacy, and intertextuality. Throughout the book prominence is given to the intentionality of actors as knowledgeable agents who transform ritual itself through play and improvisation. Integral to the narrative are interpolations about performances and their meanings by Kolawole Ositola, a scholar of Yoruba oral tradition, ritual practitioner, diviner, and master performer. Rich descriptions of rituals relating to birth, death, reincarnation, divination, and constructions of gender are rendered all the more vivid by a generous selection of field photos of actual performances.",['Margaret Thompson Drewal'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vxXvi8WhrrMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=vxXvi8WhrrMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Yoruba+Ritual:+Performers,+Play,+Agency&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Indiana University Press,1992-03-22,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vxXvi8WhrrMC&source=gbs_api,['History'],

In the Coils of the Snake: Book III -- The Hollow Kingdom Trilogy,"""What is the spell for?"" Miranda asked curiously, stepping close beside him to squeeze through the first ring of trees. She didn't know of any goblin spells that used flowers unless they were crushed like herbs. ""Do you really want to know?"" murmured the elf absently, looking up at the dark crowns of the ancient oaks. ""Yes,"" she said. She had always liked magic. He glanced back down at her then. ""It's for you,"" he said. And the instant they passed the great trunks, his hand closed over her wrist. The powerful final volume of the Hollow Kingdom Trilogy Miranda has waited her whole life to come home to the goblin kingdom, but she never imagined she'd feel so alone there. Her beloved Marak, the center of her world since childhood, has reached the end of his reign. But Marak didn't raise a coward. Miranda needs all her courage when a mysterious elf lord takes her prisoner, reigniting an age-old battle. Caught between two hostile races, she becomes their greatest reason for war—and their only hope for a future. In this final volume of the Hollow Kingdom Trilogy, Clare B.

Dispatches from the Front: Theological Engagements with the Secular,"God knows it is hard to make God boring, Stanley Hauerwas writes, but American Christians, aided and abetted by theologians, have accomplished that feat. Whatever might be said about Hauerwas—and there is plenty—no one has ever accused him of being boring, and in this book he delivers another jolt to all those who think that Christian theology is a matter of indifference to our secular society. At once Christian theology and social criticism, this book aims to show that the two cannot be separated. In this spirit, Hauerwas mounts a forceful attack on current sentimentalities about the significance of democracy, the importance of the family, and compassion, which appears here as a literally fatal virtue. In this time of the decline of religious knowledge, when knowing a little about a religion tends to do more harm than good, Hauerwas offers direction to those who would make Christian discourse both useful and truthful. Animated by a deep commitment, his essays exhibit the difference that Christian theology can make in the shaping of lives and the world.",['Stanley Hauerwas'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SzXPYR0ym8AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=SzXPYR0ym8AC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Dispatches+from+the+Front:+Theological+Engagements+with+the+Secular&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Duke University Press,1995,http://books.google.nl/books?id=SzXPYR0ym8AC&dq=Dispatches+from+the+Front:+Theological+Engagements+with+the+Secular&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],1.0
Blood,"(1) ONSTERFELIJK - De zeventienjarige Allie moet zien te overleven in een verwoeste wereld waarin vampiers de macht hebben. Nadat een van haar voedselstrooptochten haar bijna fataal is geworden, laat meestervampier Kanin haar kiezen: sterven of een vampier worden. Ze kiest voor het laatste, en dat brengt weer heel andere problemen met zich mee. Wat het betekent om een vampier te zijn, merkt ze pas echt als ze verliefd wordt op de dappere, loyale en zéér menselijke Zeke. Wat zal er gebeuren als hij erachter komt wat ze werkelijk is? Haar hart mag dan niet meer kloppen, maar dat wil niet zeggen dat het niet gebroken kan worden... (2) BLOEDBAND - Nu ze Zeke, de jongen op wie ze verliefd is, heeft moeten achterlaten in Eden, heeft Allie nog maar één doel voor ogen: haar maker, Kanin, redden uit de klauwen van de psychopatische vampier Sarren. En ze voelt dat ze niet veel tijd meer heeft. Het spoor leidt haar naar haar geboorteplaats, de plek waar het allemaal begonnen is. Als ze daar aankomt, blijkt Sarren met het dodelijke roodlongvirus te hebben geëxperimenteerd, waardoor nu niet alleen mensen maar ook vampiers groot gevaar lopen...

Standing Still,"If we do not make a real effort to understand some of the behaviors of care-dependent clients, we not only miss out on the opportunity to meet the underlying need and truly resolve the issue, but we also might actually cause much greater harm to those for whom we are caring; the hurt of not truly being heard and seen, which leads to deep-seated loneliness. In this book, Geert takes you by the hand and gently walks you toward a whole new level of thinking and approaching situations, and at the end you will find yourself armed with a wealth of possibilities (as long as you allow your mind to shift remain receptive). This book gives a voice to all those who are dependent on others and, in a way, also to ourselves, as one day it might be we who need compassionate care.",['Geert Bettinger'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0nUzDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=0nUzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA39&dq=Standing+Still&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,FriesenPress,2017-08-28,http://books.google.nl/books?id=0nUzDwAAQBAJ&dq=Standing+Still&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Medical'],

The Widowing of Mrs. Holroyd: A Drama in Three Acts (Pine Street Books),"The Widowing of Mrs. Holroyd, written immediately after Sons and Lovers, is one of D. H. Lawrence's most significant early works. The play, Lawrence's first, is the alter ego of the story ""Odour of Chrysanthemums"" and, like the short story, deals with a catastrophe in the lives of a coal mining family. Drawing upon the intensity of events that unfold in the miner's kitchen, the play explores a marriage bowed under the weight of a husband's drinking and infidelity and peers into the strange, burgeoning relationship between the neglected wife, Mrs. Holroyd, and the young electrician in whom she seeks emotional refuge. First published in 1914, The Widowing of Mrs. Holroyd is a bare tracing of the ways in which a marriage has gone wrong.",['D. H.

The Dutchman,"On Oct, 23, 1935, a rusty, steel-jacketed .45 slug tore through the body of 33-year-old Dutch Schultz, the Beer Baron of The Bronx who reaped $2 million a month as king of Harlem's numbers racket. It was no accident. The Dutchman had gone too far, having threatened to murder Thomas E. Dewey-the racket's prosecutor who'd drawn up the tax indictment against him. The result was the biggest gangland execution since the 1929 St. Valentine's Day Massacre in Al Capone's Chicago. In this 1930s real-life whodunit set in the Prohibition era, legendary New York newspaperman Paul Sann investigates the meteoric rise of gangster Dutch Schultz (born Arthur Flegenheimer), mean-streaked bully, alleged killer and reader of books, tracking the blood-flecked story from the Lower East Side and Bronx sidewalks, to Broadway night spots, lavish Park Avenue penthouses and, ultimately, to City Hall-along the way uncovering the truces and alliances among politicians, police, unions and racketeers. But Schultz didn't die instantly, lingering over a day, a police stenographer at his bedside recording his every word. Dutch's surrealistic, Joycean stream-of-consciousness deathbed ramblings are reproduced here in full and Sann explores the meaning of the poetic jumble of some of his last words: ""I am a pretty good pretzeler [sic], Please crack down on the Chinaman's friends and Hitler's commander,"" and his most majestic utterance, ""Mother is the best bet and don't let Satan draw you too fast.""",,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8iBQrgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=8iBQrgEACAAJ&dq=The+Dutchman&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2015-03-07,http://books.google.nl/books?id=8iBQrgEACAAJ&dq=The+Dutchman&hl=&source=gbs_api,,

Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy,"On May 10, 1996, Lene Gammelgaard became the first Scandinavian woman to reach the summit of Mount Everest. But a raging storm and human error conspired to turn triumph into catastrophe. Eight of her team's climbers, including its renowned leader Scott Fischer, perished in a tragedy that would make headlines around the world. In her riveting account, Gammelgaard takes us from her weeks of determined training to the exhilaration of arriving in Nepal to the arduous climb and deadly storm that forced her and her fellow climbers to huddle throughout the night, hoping to stay alive. Gammelgaard also writes movingly of Everest's awesome beauty; of the passion and commitment required to face the daunting challenge of climbing to high altitudes; and of the complex personal relationships forged in the pursuit of such dangerous ventures.

Soul of Viktor Tronko,"When Soviet agent Viktor Tronko defected to the US in 1964, he made two intriguing claims: he insisted that Russia had not placed a mole inside the CIA, and that Lee Harvey Oswald had not been recruited to assassinate the president. Convinced that Tronko was working as a disinformation agent, the CIA furiously did everything they could to break him. But Tronko had one more surprise for them: he refused to break. Almost two decades later, former CIA officer Mel Pokorny shows up at journalist Michael Kessler's house and offers to talk about Tronko. It's the scoop of a lifetime for Kessler. But the more he investigates, the closer he gets to the truth: a truth so shocking that someone would do anything to keep it under wraps. This could be the biggest story of his life...if it doesn't kill him first.

Quantitative Analysis of Movement: Measuring and Modeling Population Redistribution in Animals and Plants,"In the last two decades it has become increasingly clear that the spatial dimension is a critically important aspect of ecological dynamics. Ecologists are currently investing an enormous amount of effort in quantifying movement patterns of organisms. Connecting these data to general issues in metapopulation biology and landscape ecology, as well as to applied questions in conservation and natural resource management, however, has proved to be a non-trivial task. This book presents a systematic exposition of quantitative methods for analyzing and modeling movements of organisms in the field. Quantitative Analysis of Movement is intended for graduate students and researchers interested in spatial ecology, including applications to conservation, pest control, and fisheries.

The Urban School: A Factory for Failure,"Americans worry continually about their schools with frequent discussions of the ""crisis"" in American education, of the ""failures"" of the public school systems, and of the inability of schools to meet the current challenges of contemporary life. Such concerns date back at least to the nineteenth century. A thread that weaves its way through the critiques of American elementary and secondary schools is that the educational system is not serving its children well, that more should be done to enhance achievement and higher performance. These critiques first began when the United States was industrializing and were later amplified when the Soviets and Japan were thought to be grinding down the competitive position of America. At the start of the twenty-first century, as we discuss globalization and maintaining our leadership position in the world economy, they are being heard again. The Urban School: A Factory for Failure challenges these assumptions about American education. Indeed, a basic premise of the book is that the American school system is working quite well-doing exactly what is expected of it. To wit, that the schools in the United States affirm, reflect, and reinforce the social inequalities that exist in the social structures of the society. Stated differently, the schools are not great engines for equalizing the existing social inequalities. Rather, they work to reinforce the social class differences that we have had in the past and continue to have in more pronounced ways at present. Rist uses both sociological and anthropological methods to examine life in one segregated African-American school in the mid-western United States. A classroom of some thirty children were followed from their first day of kindergarten through the second grade. Detailed accounts of the day-by-day process of sorting, stratifying, and separating the children by social class backgrounds demonstrates the means of ensuring that both the poor and middle-class students soon learned their appropriate place in the social hierarchy of the school. Instructional time, discipline, and teacher attention all varied by social class of the students, with those at the bottom of the ladder consistently receiving few positive rewards and many negative sanctions. When The Urban School was first published in 1973, the National School Boards Association called it one of the ten most influential books on American education for the year. It remains essential reading for educators, sociologists, and economists.",['Christian Karner'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YG5QDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=YG5QDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Urban+School:+A+Factory+for+Failure&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2017-09-29,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YG5QDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Education'],

"Developing Your Sixth Sense (Master Your Awareness for Greater Clarity, wisdom, and Power)","Most of us go through life experiencing only the material world, using our five physical senses - and not to their full potential, at that. But on rare occasions, we will catch a glimpse of the hidden, mysterious aspect of our existence, a flash of insight or inspiration received through the sixth sense. What we call ""the sixth sense"" is a natural, intuitive state of higher consciousness and spiritual awareness, a special power of inner knowing and psychic ability. Everyone has it, although it lies dormant in most people. But if nurtured and developed - a process easier than one might think - the sixth sense can be awakened, honed, and used to achieve greater joy and understanding in every aspect of your life, from your relationships to your financial affairs. In Developing Your Sixth Sense, world-renowned author and lecturer Stuart Wilde will show you practical ways to tap into this profound ability to improve the quality of your life's journey. You will learn: Seven levels of supersensory communication. How to win people over and discover the real meanings behind their words. How to control your etheric body. An action plan for creating your own luck. How to be a powerhouse of creativity. Energy patterns for loving relationships. The ESP of easy money. A system for recognizing ""types"" of people and avoiding the demands they can place on you. How to open and energize your chakras for healing. Why it's important not to interfere. How to protect yourself from negative energy. Techniques for communicating with other realms of existence. And much more... an infinite adventure.",['Stuart Wilde'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UnNYEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UnNYEAAAQBAJ&dq=Developing+Your+Sixth+Sense+(Master+Your+Awareness+for+Greater+Clarity,+wisdom,+and+Power)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Gildan Media LLC aka G&D Media,2022-09-20,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UnNYEAAAQBAJ&dq=Developing+Your+Sixth+Sense+(Master+Your+Awareness+for+Greater+Clarity,+wisdom,+and+Power)&hl=&source=gbs_api","['Body, Mind & Spirit']",
The Grounds of English Literature,"The centuries just after the Norman Conquest are the forgotten period of English literary history. In fact, the years 1066-1300 witnessed an unparalleled ingenuity in the creation of written forms, for this was a time when almost every writer was unaware of the existence of other English writing. In a series of detailed readings of the more important early Middle English works, Cannon shows how the many and varied texts of the period laid the foundations for the project of English literature. This richness is for the first time given credit in these readings by means of an innovative theory of literary form that accepts every written shape as itself a unique contribution to the history of ideas. This theory also suggests that the impoverished understanding of literature we now commonly employ is itself a legacy of this early period, an attribute of the single form we have learned to call 'romance'. A number of reading methods have lately taught us to be more generous in our understandings of what literature might be, but this book shows us that the very variety we now strive to embrace anew actually formed the grounds of English literature-a richness we only lost when we forgot how to recognize it.",['Christopher Cannon'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aQoGz91Ku-QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=aQoGz91Ku-QC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Grounds+of+English+Literature&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,OUP Oxford,2004-12-09,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aQoGz91Ku-QC&source=gbs_api,['Literary Criticism'],

Tales of Wisdom & Wonder,"Christians and Jews, as well as Moslems, called Jalaludin Rumi their teacher. Born in Afghanistan in the 13th century, Rumi is widely considered one of the greatest mystical teachers, and perhaps the greatest mystical poet, of all time. An important theme of Rumi's work is the danger of ""mistaking the container for the content."" He regarded even his own poetry as a ""container"" for the real purpose of his work. The Hundred Tales of Wisdom is a collection of events and ""action teachings"" from Rumi's life, with stories, fables, and verse from his work. A classic, the book has been used in Sufi schools for more than 700 years as a teaching instrument to help develop insights beyond ordinary perceptions.","['Shams al-Dīn Aḥmad Aflākī', 'Jalāl al-Dīn Rūmī (Maulana)']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zsbYAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=zsbYAAAAMAAJ&q=Tales+of+Wisdom&dq=Tales+of+Wisdom&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Ishk Book Service,1978,http://books.google.nl/books?id=zsbYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Tales+of+Wisdom&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Philosophy'],

Three Great Novels of World War II,"A SLOW MOVING TARGET, The LSTs Of World War II, is a historical novel that contains many authentic stories about the turmoil and hardships that the Amphibious Fleet endured during beach invasions in World War II. To enhance the military adversities, the story revolves around the personal lives of five young fictitious sailors who, in 1942, enlisted in the U.S. Navy to defend their country against the Axis. They come from different parts of America and meet in the same boot-camp at Bainbridge, Maryland. As a result of the difficulties they encounter in boot-camp and in the war they become life-long buddies. After boot-camp was completed they were transferred to the dreaded and perilous Amphibious fleet of LSTs (Landing Ship Tank), because the LST is truly a A Slow Moving Target having the reputation of a brief life during an invasion. In this historical novel each principle character in the book presents his own unique and unusual experiences. The main character of the novel is John Maroni, who attempts to keep the group together and to preserve their friendship throughout the war. They call themselves The Five Phibies. The Five Phibies are later split-up and are transferred to different LSTs which compelled them to fight in separate campaigns in both the Pacific and Atlantic theaters. They continued to communicate with one another via one central location in the States. They send their mail to John Maroni's kid sister, Angela, in Queens, New York, who rewrites the letters by relating their war experiences, their health, and anything new about their personal lives, but deliberately leaving out any unpleasant ordeals, then sending the letters on to the Phibies. Phibie No. 1 is John Maroni who was born in Queens, New York. Phibie No. 2 is Dan Bletcher born in Dover, New Jersey. Phibie No. 3 is Andre Robbier born in Chicago, Illinois. Phibie No. 4 is Rich Hienman born in Dallas, Texas. Phibie No. 5 is Bob Olsen born in Boston, Massachusetts. Understandably, most historical World War II novels are written around large fighting vessels such as aircraft carriers, battle ships, cruisers, destroyers, and submarines. Very little is written about the LST and their amphibious operations on beach landings of unloading troops and cargo because it isn't a glamorized fighting ship. The book provides many authentic LST battles which are depicted through the fictional characters presented in this novel. The author tried to encompass the five Phibies in several authentic battles even though their characters and experiences were created by his own imagination. The LST played a very important role in the military operations in the islands in the Pacific, and during the invasions of France, Italy, and Africa. Without the LST and its ramp, the delivery of cargo to the beaches during an assault would have been extremely difficult and time consuming. The LST was not the most elegant looking ship to come out of American shipyards but it was designed for a purpose, to deliver men and cargo to an invading beach as quickly as possible, and to support the Allied troops ashore with ammunition, tanks, jeeps, trucks, artillery, medical supplies, and most critical of all food and water. Without these back-up goods the war may have been extended a year or more which would have cost many more American lives. The LST and the other Amphibious forces must be recognized for their part in the war by being one of the most essential components of World War II, and should be commended for their effort in the invasion of hostile enemies both in the Pacific and in the Atlantic theaters. This author attempts to do just that. The novel does not cover the land struggle after an invasion because the ground assaults have already been covered by other authors, and to repeat them here would serve no other purpose but to reiterate their achievements.",['Joseph Panicello'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jcQYr-Zd6_EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=jcQYr-Zd6_EC&pg=PA339&dq=Three+Great+Novels+of+World+War+II&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,AuthorHouse,2002-02-19,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jcQYr-Zd6_EC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],

It examines the entire period during which the party had a systematic and organized approach to cinematographic production, starting with the early experiments in 1946 and concluding with the closure of PCI film company Unitelefilm at the end of the 1970s. Its analysis sheds light on a range of issues, such as the relationship between the party and Italian intellectuals, the Stalinist imprint of the Italian Communist Party and the historical significance of the Salerno turn, the PCI’s relationship with the student movements in 1968 and 1977, and the PCI’s response to the rise in political violence in the 1970s.

VLSI Engineering,"Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) CMOS technology has been regarded as another major technology for VLSI in addition to bulk CMOS technology. Owing to the buried oxide structure, SOI technology offers superior CMOS devices with higher speed, high density, and reduced second order effects for deep-submicron low-voltage, low-power VLSI circuits applications. In addition to VLSI applications, and because of its outstanding properties, SOI technology has been used to realize communication circuits, microwave devices, BICMOS devices, and even fiber optics applications. CMOS VLSI Engineering: Silicon-On-Insulator addresses three key factors in engineering SOI CMOS VLSI - processing technology, device modelling, and circuit designs are all covered with their mutual interactions. Starting from the SOI CMOS processing technology and the SOI CMOS digital and analog circuits, behaviors of the SOI CMOS devices are presented, followed by a CAD program, ST-SPICE, which incorporates models for deep-submicron fully-depleted mesa-isolated SOI CMOS devices and special purpose SOI devices including polysilicon TFTs. CMOS VLSI Engineering: Silicon-On-Insulator is written for undergraduate senior students and first-year graduate students interested in CMOS VLSI. It will also be suitable for electrical engineering professionals interested in microelectronics.","['James B.

The Science of Consciousness,"This book explains in layperson's terms a new approach to studying consciousness based on a partnership between neuroscientists and complexity scientists. The author, a physicist turned neuroscientist, outlines essential features of this partnership. The new science goes well beyond traditional cognitive science and simple neural networks, which are often the focus in artificial intelligence research. It involves many fields including neuroscience, artificial intelligence, physics, cognitive science, and psychiatry. What causes autism, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease? How does our unconscious influence our actions? As the author shows, these important questions can be viewed in a new light when neuroscientists and complexity scientists work together. This cross-disciplinary approach also offers fresh insights into the major unsolved challenge of our age: the origin of self-awareness. Do minds emerge from brains? Or is something more involved? Using human social networks as a metaphor, the author explains how brain behavior can be compared with the collective behavior of large-scale global systems. Emergent global systems that interact and form relationships with lower levels of organization and the surrounding environment provide useful models for complex brain functions. By blending lucid explanations with illuminating analogies, this book offers the general reader a window into the latest exciting developments in brain research.",['Paul L.

It is an approach that can be harmonized with other recognized critical approaches to the Bible, from historical criticism to ecofeminist criticism.

Enlightenment against Empire,"In the late eighteenth century, an array of European political thinkers attacked the very foundations of imperialism, arguing passionately that empire-building was not only unworkable, costly, and dangerous, but manifestly unjust. Enlightenment against Empire is the first book devoted to the anti-imperialist political philosophies of an age often regarded as affirming imperial ambitions. Sankar Muthu argues that thinkers such as Denis Diderot, Immanuel Kant, and Johann Gottfried Herder developed an understanding of humans as inherently cultural agents and therefore necessarily diverse. These thinkers rejected the conception of a culture-free ""natural man."" They held that moral judgments of superiority or inferiority could be made neither about entire peoples nor about many distinctive cultural institutions and practices. Muthu shows how such arguments enabled the era's anti-imperialists to defend the freedom of non-European peoples to order their own societies. In contrast to those who praise ""the Enlightenment"" as the triumph of a universal morality and critics who view it as an imperializing ideology that denigrated cultural pluralism, Muthu argues instead that eighteenth-century political thought included multiple Enlightenments. He reveals a distinctive and underappreciated strand of Enlightenment thinking that interweaves commitments to universal moral principles and incommensurable ways of life, and that links the concept of a shared human nature with the idea that humans are fundamentally diverse. Such an intellectual temperament, Muthu contends, can broaden our own perspectives about international justice and the relationship between human unity and diversity.",['Sankar Muthu'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=abiDEbUjrMsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=abiDEbUjrMsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Enlightenment+against+Empire&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Princeton University Press,2009-01-10,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=abiDEbUjrMsC&source=gbs_api,['Philosophy'],

BloodRune,"Taj Odin Xavier returns home to find his father dead and his king ready to surrender the key to the city-state he s always called home. His friends are all dead. But remnants from his travels and things found and earned along the way push the renegade army threatening Eternis to decimation. After saving the city from capture, Taj turns his aggression towards the city that let his father down; the same man that spent a lifetime serving it. He cast down the churches of all faiths, save those of Draconic origin. He allows the Draconic Order to remain prevalent in the city due to it being the dragons that come down to help him. After, he focuses his newfound aggression towards the Republic of New Magic, more specifically Marko Kane, the killer of King Gerear s eldest son. Taj tries to utilize what heart he has left to rekindle the romance between him and Destiny but an act he deems as betrayal is too much for him. With Destiny forcing him to stay out of it, he orders a newfound ally to execute the culprit. With matters settled in Eternis, he and his new allies set sail for the Republic of New Magic; Runethedian s first outpost against the unending ships and armies of the New Threat, sometimes called the Northern Threat. At first, he plans only to stay long enough to avenge his king s eldest son. But then the war begins to consume him and the things the Father Vampire left inside him begin to writhe in his chest once again. This proves to Taj he s not fully gone. But those powers prove useful in the fight against the New Threat. In the end, he ultimately decides to sail to the heart of the beast in hopes of either securing a truce or ending its life. With every passing day, Taj Odin Xavier loses more of his humanity. Will any of it remain once the war against the New Threat is over? That is, assuming he lives of course. """,['Dallas S.

ISO 9000 ABC's: The Small Company Guide to Successful Registration,"ISO 9000 is increasingly impacting smaller companies as larger companies demand that their supplier base have a formal quality system. Companies with less than 500 employees often spend too much time trying to understand the standards, changing their current systems, and over documenting every aspect of their daily operations. Time is money, and since many smaller companies delegate the project to one individual - who already has a full time job -understanding the basics as quickly as possible is essential. With anything new there is required research and knowledge - this book shortens the learning curve by explaining the key points, possible pitfalls, costs, and requirements to achieving registration. The author walks you through the process step-by-step, supplying examples of required documentation, auditor questions, methods of compliance, and basic program suggestions. Included in the text are two quality manuals. The accompanying disk contains templates for these quality manuals, procedures, forms and documents that can be revised as needed. Each procedure gives you a clear overview of what is required and serves as a boilerplate for quick modification and procedure generation. The disk makes individualizing the ISO 9000 documentation to your company easy. ISO 9000 ABC's: The Small Company Guide to Successful Registration provides a very clear picture of all aspects of the ISO process and takes the guess work out of what to document and how.

Phoenix In The Ashes.,"Phoenix from the Ashes is a comprehensive look at the state of the Catholic Church since the Second Vatican Council--one of a series of recurrent periods of moral and intellectual crisis to which it has succumbed in its history. A chapter on the Council describes in detail how Pope Paul VI diverted it by placing it under the exclusive control of European liberals. An equally close study is devoted to the liturgical ""reform"" entrusted by the same pope to a group of radicals whose work undermined the spiritual and devotional legacy of the faithful. The loss of orthodox teaching and the disorientation following upon these changes produced a grave crisis in both clergy and laity, but the movement of return to tradition visible today promises a revival of the full Catholic life of the Church. Catholic readers now have a complete and eminently accessible account of the last 50 years of momentous changes in the Church, right up to the pontificates of Benedict XVI and Francis I. ""This wide-ranging account of the self-destruction of the Roman Catholic Church and its identification of her only realistic route back to the land of the living simultaneously strikes a blow at history's two most prevalent temptations: rejection or twisting of evidence in the service of an ideological thesis, and honest dedication to intense research on subjects whose ultimate existential value the 'unbiased' historian somehow fears to reveal to his readers. Henry Sire courageously shuts no doors and stifles no evidence, employing a passionate and lively prose that leaves no doubt regarding his sense of the crucial moral and cultural importance of his topic.""--JOHN RAO, author of Black Legends and the Light of the World and Removing the Blindfold ""For Catholics feeling lost at sea as a result of the turbulent crisis tossing and flooding the Barque of Peter, Henry Sire's work identifies clear landmarks to steady our gaze. He situates the present disarray within the larger historical context of the Arian heresy and Protestant revolution, and points to the buoys of tradition--liturgical, doctrinal, and philosophical--as sure guides to our way out. Sire distills entire epochs of history, from the first centuries of the Church through the current pontificate, into a highly readable and thought-provoking story. In the course of his tale he exposes the radical progressivism of the Second Vatican Council and its after-effects as well as the tepid conservatism of the Reform of the Reform and the Hermeneutic of Continuity.""--BRIAN M. MCCALL, author of To Build the City of God ""Historian H.J.A. Sire has compiled a balanced assessment of the revolution in the Roman Catholic Church. His mastery of the material is complete. The book flows along easily and readers will finish it confident that they have a comprehensive understanding of the last 60 years in the Church.""--ROGER MCCAFFREY, President, Roman Catholic Books ""Thanks to Henry Sire's penetrating book, we have some profound answers to nagging questions. How did the West end up so quickly in a post-Christian age, when only decades ago one could still speak of a Christian culture? How did we go from the seemingly healthy Roman Catholic Church of the 1950s to the mass apostasy and grave scandals of recent years? As Sire shows, the antecedents go back quite far, in fact many centuries, but the possibility of healing and regeneration is not as remote as we think.""--STEPHEN KLIMCZUK-MASSION, Senior Adviser, Hildebrand Project H.J.A.

"Baby, Oh Baby! (Time of Your Life)","The Sissy Baby is an incredibly important and common aspect of ABDL life. These four novels are not books that are a full-on sissy extravaganza from the first word until the last. They are – like in real life – a step-by-step journey that follows the story of a young man who finds femininity erupting in his life, just as infancy is also developing. The twin aspect merge and a sissy baby is formed. And in every case, the sissy baby needs to find a life where they are able to live, develop, grow and be part of a relationship that works and matters. I hope you enjoy these four novels as much as the authors enjoyed writing them and it is worth remembering that while they are fiction, they do represent part of the canvas of real life and some scenes are based in part on actual events. Enjoy your travels through the world of the sissy adult baby.","['Ben Pathen', 'Michael Bent', 'Madeline Wood']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vG3SDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=vG3SDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA75&dq=Baby,+Oh+Baby!+(Time+of+Your+Life)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",AB Discovery,2020-02-25,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vG3SDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,,

He Knew He Was Right (Worlds Classics),"Trollope is usually seen as a faithful mirror of Victorian England, both in providing intimate details of contemporary life and in endorsing the moral attitudes and certainties of the period. His powers of empathy make his characters convincing and knowable in an astonishing way. Yet the Victorians restricted women to the house and severely limited their rights and opportunities. Trollope and Women examens the conundrum of how a great novelist could both accept the conventional values of the time and yet be able to see and sympathise with the impossible situations in which Victorian women often found themselves. Margaret Markwick shows the individuality of Trollope's women: even conventional Angel in the House heroines, like Mary Lowther in The Vicar of Bullhampton, can surprise us at times. More tellingly, he cannot help giving some of his less angelic characters, such as the vivacious Lizzie Eustace in the Eustace Diamonds, his unwilling admiration. His range extends beyond simple romance to the realistic handling of marriages, both happy and unhappy, and to the treatment of bigamy and scandal. He shows men and women getting on together as well as fighting bitterly. Nor are Trollope's novels as devoid of sex as has often been thought.",['Margaret Markwick'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9gbBya-KjMwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=9gbBya-KjMwC&pg=PA205&dq=He+Knew+He+Was+Right+(Worlds+Classics)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,A&C Black,1997-01-01,http://books.google.nl/books?id=9gbBya-KjMwC&dq=He+Knew+He+Was+Right+(Worlds+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Literary Criticism'],

Writing Women's Worlds: Bedouin Stories,"Extrait de la couverture : "" In 1978 Lila Abu-Lughod climbed out of a dusty van to meet members of a small Awlad 'Ali Bedouin community. Living in this Egyptian Bedouin settlement for extended periods during the following decade, Abu-Lughod took part in family life, with its moments of humor, affection, and anger. As the new teller of these tales Abu-Lughod draws on anthropological and feminist insights to construct a critical ethnography. She explores how the telling of these stories challenges the power of anthropological theory to render adequately the lives of others and the way feminist theory appropriates Third World women. Writing Women's Worlds is thus at once a vivid set of stories and a study in the politics of representation.""",['Lila Abu-Lughod'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N6gwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=N6gwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Writing+Women%27s+Worlds:+Bedouin+Stories&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Univ of California Press,2008-04-07,http://books.google.nl/books?id=N6gwDwAAQBAJ&dq=Writing+Women%27s+Worlds:+Bedouin+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Social Science'],

"Poetry and Repetition: Walt Whitman, Wallace Stevens, John Ashbery (Literary Criticism and Cultural Theory)","This book examines the function of repetition in the work of Walt Whitman, Wallace Stevens and John Ashbery. All three poets extensively employ and comment upon the effects of repetition, yet represent three distinct poetics, considerably removed from one another in stylistic and historical terms. At the same time, the three are engaged in a highly interesting relation to each other - a relation readers tend to explain in terms of repetition, by positing Whitman and Stevens as the two alternative 'beginnings' out of which Ashbery emerges. Krystyna Mazur analyses the work of the three poets to discern patterns that may operate across a relatively broad spectrum of examples, as well as to consider the variety of ways in which repetition can structure a poetic text.",['Krystyna Mazur'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4CyUAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4CyUAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Poetry+and+Repetition:+Walt+Whitman,+Wallace+Stevens,+John+Ashbery+(Literary+Criticism+and+Cultural+Theory)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Routledge,2006-06-02,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4CyUAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Literary Criticism'],
INFRARED DETECTORS & SYSTEMS,"Infrared Detectors and Systems offers a deep and detailed examination of the optical detection process and the electronics of mimicking the eye. It further explores recent research in new detector materials and the latest advances in optical detectors. This text covers the range of subjects necessary for the understanding of modern infrared-imaging systems at a level appropriate for seniors or first-year graduate students in physics or electrical engineering. The first six chapters focus on fundamental background issues of radiation detection, beginning with the basics of geometrical optics and finishing with a discussion of the figures of merit used for describing the signal-to-noise performance of a detector system. Other topics include radiometry and flux-transfer issues, basic radiation-detector mechanisms, and random-process mathematics. The book concludes with a close look at infrared detection systems and related issues. In the discussion of infrared search systems, the range equation is developed in terms of the optical and detector parameters of the system. A separate chapter is devoted to modulation transfer function, a spatial-frequency-domain description of image quality. The final chapter describes the design equations for thermal-imager systems in terms of noise-equivalent temperature difference and minimum resolvable temperature. Supported and clarified by 470 illustrations and accompanied by an extensive glossary of the nomenclature, this is an excellent text for graduate and senior level courses in radiometry and infrared detectors. It is also a valuable reference for practicing engineers involved in the use, design, analysis, and testing of infrared detector-based systems.","['E. L. Dereniak', 'G. D.

"Henry James: Complete Stories, 1892-1898 (Library of America)","This Library of America volume is one of five that make available for the first time in new, complete, and authoritative editions the astonishing abundance of invention and unwavering intensity of the aesthetic vision of Henry James as displayed in more than one hundred world-famous stories ranging from brief anecdotes to richly developed novellas. Equally adept at ironic comedy, muted tragedy, and supernatural fantasy, at lively social satire and nuanced portraiture, James in his shorter works explores a staggering variety of situations and emotions. Here are courtships and legacies; the worlds of literature, theater, and the popular press; the paradoxes of temperament and the constraints of custom; the clash of conscience and desire. Stylistically, the stories allowed James to experiment with tones and devices quite different from his novels—dramatic plot twists and surprise endings, swift pacing and ebullient humor. The brilliance of his technical command allowed him to transform the tiniest of suggestions—a fleetingly observed gesture, an anecdote dropped at a dinner party—into fiction remarkable for its lambent surfaces and intricate psychological counterpoint. The twenty-one stories in this volume represent James at the peak of his storytelling powers. Among them are “The Turn of the Screw,” one of his most popular works, and a terrifying exercise in psychological horror centering on the corruption of childhood innocence; “The Real Thing,” a playful consideration of the illusion of art and the paradoxes of authenticity; “The Figure in the Carpet,” “The Death of the Lion,” and “The Middle Years,” three very different expositions of the mysteries of authorship, embodying some of James’s most profound insights into the nature of his own art; “The Altar of the Dead,” a somber, ultimately wrenching meditation on the relation of the living to the dead; and “In the Cage,” an extended evocation of the inner life of a young woman trapped in a dehumanizing job at a postal-and-telegraph office. LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation’s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America’s best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries.","['Henry James', 'John Hollander']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VYMqNHbJwK8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VYMqNHbJwK8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Henry+James:+Complete+Stories,+1892-1898+(Library+of+America)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Library of America,1996-01-01,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VYMqNHbJwK8C&dq=Henry+James:+Complete+Stories,+1892-1898+(Library+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Fiction'],

We travel through each of the forty-eight Propositions-more or less in order-and see how each one generalizes-or does not generalize-to hyperbolic and other non-Euclidean spaces. Few people seem to realize that Einstein's special theory of relativity is a model of hyperbolic geometry. The connection between Minkowski geometry and special relativity is well-known, while the connection between hyperbolic geometry and special relativity is, rather, known of. But this book makes the hyperbolic connection explicit; Poincare disks rather than the traditional Minkowski diagrams are used to illustrate concepts of special relativity. As we progress through Euclid's propositions, it becomes increasingly clear that every theorem in neutral and hyperbolic geometry can be translated into a true statement in special relativity.""",['Ben Jacobs'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rIf0wAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=rIf0wAEACAAJ&dq=On+Beyond+Euclid&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2006-02,http://books.google.nl/books?id=rIf0wAEACAAJ&dq=On+Beyond+Euclid&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Mathematics'],

Finnegans Wake,"A daring work of experimental, Modernist genius, James Joyce's Finnegans Wake is one of the greatest literary achievements of the twentieth century, and the crowning glory of Joyce's life. The Penguin Modern Classics edition of includes an introduction by Seamus Deane 'riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs' Joyce's final work, Finnegan's Wake is his masterpiece of the night as Ulysses is of the day. Supreme linguistic virtuosity conjures up the dark underground worlds of sexuality and dream. Joyce undermines traditional storytelling and all official forms of English and confronts the different kinds of betrayal - cultural, political and sexual - that he saw at the heart of Irish history. Dazzlingly inventive, with passages of great lyrical beauty and humour, Finnegans Wake remains one of the most remarkable works of the twentieth century. James Joyce (1882-1941), the eldest of ten children, was born in Dublin, but exiled himself to Paris at twenty as a rebellion against his upbringing.

Single in Saudi,"Bored at work and nursing a broken heart, a thirty something R.N. leaves her prestigious job at a Houston medical center to work at a military hospital in Saudi Arabia in 1978. She arrives in a land struggling to catch up to the Western world while retaining its strict Muslim morality — at least in public. “Genia,” a bold, single, blue-eyed blonde, discovers that sex and drugs are very much in demand inside the high-walled compounds of the Western-educated Saudi elite. During two years in The Kingdom, Genia manages to break every rule short of theft and murder while befriending Arabs of all social standing, including her grateful patients. A hot-shot Saudi Air Force pilot and a top Saudi official become her lovers, and she parties with princes and princesses at their opulent homes and Bedouin camps. But she also dons the veil and long, black obaya in order to move freely among the ordinary Saudis who welcome her into their homes. With plenty of overtime pay and vacation time, Genia travels to more than twenty five countries while based in Saudi Arabia. She describes these travels, along with her relationships, nursing work, and unleashed feminism in this extraordinary memoir of a time when America wasn’t a dirty word in the Arab world.",['Genia'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9Umk1oU6WO4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=9Umk1oU6WO4C&pg=PA5&dq=Single+in+Saudi&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,AuthorHouse,2002-11-11,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9Umk1oU6WO4C&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],

"""In the Days of Serfdom"" and Other Stories (Pine Street Books)","""In the Days of Serfdom"" and Other Stories, originally published in 1911, presents in miniature themes developed in Tolstoy's longer works War and Peace and Anna Karenina. The compelling stories in this collection have largely been ignored by contemporary scholars and teachers because of their general unavailability. Available once again, the stories reveal new thematic and stylisitic dimensions to Tolstoy's oeuvre. While not all of the stories deal with actual serfdom, they all address the legacy of serfdom, of choicelessness, in Tolstoy's Russia. These stories are also thoroughly modern, concerned as they are with the market economy, changing values, and women's roles in society. Artistically and historically significant, they constitute ethical and spiritual questionings that deal with lives out of control, with characters making sense of the experience of living.",['Leo Tolstoy'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JMvoBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=JMvoBAAAQBAJ&pg=PR4&dq=%22In+the+Days+of+Serfdom%22+and+Other+Stories+(Pine+Street+Books)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,University of Pennsylvania Press,2014-10-24,http://books.google.nl/books?id=JMvoBAAAQBAJ&dq=%22In+the+Days+of+Serfdom%22+and+Other+Stories+(Pine+Street+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],

Still Love in Strange Places: A Memoir,"Back in 1968 Diana Page was going to graduate from the University of Michigan without much hope for marriage or a career. She didn't have a boyfriend, so a prospective husband was unlikely to materialize before the semester ended, and a bachelor's in political science wasn't going to make her easily employable. The solution? Join the Peace Corps where she could help change the world . . . and possibly meet a guy who shared her values. Thus began Diana's adventures. Her travels as a journalist and diplomat took her down the dangerous roads of Latin American history from the 1960s into the twenty-first century. With excerpts from diaries, letters, and news articles, she weaves together a narrative of war and peace, presidents and peasants, but mostly of ordinary people who teach her about life. She also runs into a few extraordinary people along the way: Fidel Castro, Isabel Peron, Pele, Jorge Luis Borges, and Hilary Clinton among others.

Creation Regained: Biblical Basics for a Reformational Worldview,"with a Postcript coauthored by Michael W. Goheen In print for two decades and translated into eight languages, Albert Wolters's classic formulation of an integrated Christian worldview has been revised and expanded to reach new readers beyond the generation that has already benefited from this clear, concise proposal for transcending the false dichotomy between sacred and secular. Wolters begins by defining the nature and scope of a worldview, distinguishing it from philosophy and theology. He then outlines a Reformed analysis of the three basic categories in human history -- creation, fall, and redemption -- arguing that while the fall reaches into every corner of the world, Christians are called to participate in Christ's redemption of all creation. This Twentieth Anniversary edition features a new concluding chapter, coauthored with Michael Goheen, that helpfully places the discussion of worldview in a broader narrative and missional context. Praise for the first edition""This is the best statement I have come across of the 'reformational' Christian worldview. It is lucidly written, includes a lot of helpful analogies and illustrations, and is throughout generous in its spirit."" -- Nicholas Wolterstorff, Yale University""Translates the central insights and categories of the neo-Calvinist tradition into fresh, nontechnical language and clarifies them with a generous sprinkling of apt illustrations and images. . . . Highly recommended to all those desiring a crisp introduction to a Christian worldview in general or the neo-Calvinist tradition in particular."" -- ""Christian Scholar's Review""Outstanding. . . . Deserves a wide readership not only in a specifically academiccontext among teachers, preachers, and students, but also among the larger group of believers who are concerned with issues involving Christian worldview, theology, and philosophy."" -- ""Calvin Theological Journal",['Albert M.

SIMPLE GT SIKHISM-PB-OP (Simple Guides),"Moderne klassieker van Julian Barnes, Engelse schrijver van o.a. Alsof het voorbij is; deels een biografisch essay over Gustave Flaubert, deels het (fictieve) verhaal van een obsessieve zoektocht. In ‘Flauberts papegaai’ van Julian Barnes raakt Geoffrey Braithwaite, een ouder wordende arts wiens vrouw is overleden, gefascineerd door het leven en werk van Flaubert en reist regelmatig naar Frankrijk om alle plekken te bezoeken waar de schrijver gewoond en gewerkt heeft. Hij beschrijft zijn bevindingen in een poging te ontdekken wat er nu eigenlijk te weten valt over iemands leven – of het nu dat van Flaubert, van zijn overleden vrouw of van hemzelf is. ‘Flauberts papegaai’ is een briljant en bijzonder geestig hoogtepunt in het oeuvre van Julian Barnes.

A new beginning,"This book is a postmodern analysis of Ronald Reagans 1984 film, A New Beginning, which marked the coming-of-age of the televisual political campaign film. The film was a landmark in the art of political filmmaking. Its thesis proclaimed a resurgence of American pride, patriotism, and prosperity under the leadership of Ronald Reagan. A New Beginning was unprecedented for a number of reasons: it replaced the traditional nominating speech for the candidate at the Republican National Convention; its form was a hybrid documentary and advertisement; it illustrated the use of televisual rebirth rhetoric to gain public support for a political ideology; and, most importantly, the masterful project documented a shift from verbal to visual rhetoric in American presidential campaigning. The author examines the film as a cultural text and as an effective political tool. Framing, ideology, myth, and visual cliché are analytic tools used to deconstruct the film; the method combines rhetorical theory with communication theory and semiotically-based theories of film and television. Morreale gives insight into the increasingly prevalent use of television to create a political reality.",['Joanne Morreale'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-h_c_VbOQXIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=-h_c_VbOQXIC&pg=PA2&dq=A+new+beginning&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,SUNY Press,1991-07-03,http://books.google.nl/books?id=-h_c_VbOQXIC&dq=A+new+beginning&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Political Science'],

Afternoons with Mr. Hogan,"Ben Hogan's former ball shagger recounts firsthand stories of the golf legend—andreveals, for the first time, Hogan's Swing Secret, a source of mystery to golfers for more than fifty years. Ben Hogan's pro golf record is legendary. A four-time PGA Player of the Year, he celebrated sixty-three tournament wins and became known as a man of few words and fewer close friends. Most of what we know about Hogan has been based on myth and speculation. Until now. In the 1960s, though Hogan's competitive career was over, he kept the practice habits that made him famous and remade modern competitive golf. He hired seventeen-year-old Jody Vasquez to help. Each day, after driving to a remote part of the course at Shady Oaks Country Club, Hogan would spend hours hitting balls and Vasquez would retrieve them. There, and over the course of their twenty-year friendship, Hogan taught Jody the mechanics of his famous swing and shared his thoughts on playing, practicing, and course management—unknowingly revealing much about his character, values, and beliefs, and the events that shaped them. In Afternoons with Mr. Hogan, Jody Vasquez shares dozens of stories about Hogan, from the way he practiced, selected his clubs, and interacted with other star players to his little-known humor and generosity. Combining the gentle insight of Tom Kite's A Fairway to Heaven (which recalls Kite's golf education under Harvey Penick) with the sage perspective of Penick's own Little Red Book, Vasquez's tribute is funny, poignant, and full of advice for golfers of all levels.",['Jody Vasquez'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=89y0kqRmqqgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=89y0kqRmqqgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Afternoons+with+Mr.+Hogan&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2005-03-24,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=89y0kqRmqqgC&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],1.0

THE LOST ART OF DISCIPLE MAKING,"""Every believer in Jesus Christ deserves the opportunity of personal nurture and development."" says LeRoy Eims. But all too often the opportunity isn't there. We neglect the young Christian in our whirl of programs, church services, and fellowship groups. And we neglect to raise up workers and leaders who can disciple young believers into mature and fruitful Christians. In simple, practical, and biblical terms, LeRoy Eims revives the lost art of disciple making. He explains: - How the early church discipled new Christians - How to meet the basic needs of a growing Christian - How to spot and train potential workers - How to develop mature, godly leaders ""True growth takes time and tears and love and patience,"" Eims states. There is no instant maturity. This book examines the growth process in the life of a Christian and considers what nurture and guidance it takes to develop spiritually qualified workers in the church.",['LeRoy Eims'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fsOLUREI26gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=fsOLUREI26gC&printsec=frontcover&dq=THE+LOST+ART+OF+DISCIPLE+MAKING&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Zondervan,2009-07-13,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fsOLUREI26gC&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],3.0

Colorful East Broad Top,"It is the last of its breed east of the Rockies and the oldest narrow gauge railroad in the nation. Built in the early 1870s, the East Broad Top hauled iron, coal, ore, minerals and passengers for over 83 years. The three-foot-gauge trackage twisted along a picturesque 32-mile route connecting Mount Union, Orbisonia and Robertsdale in remote and beautiful south-central Pennsylvania. The ""Eastie"" earned its keep until the end of regular operations in the autumn of 1956. With the closing of the last Rockhill Coal Company mine, the EBT quietly closed its doors. It had outlived hundreds of its slim gauge counterparts across the country. The EBT connected isolated communities with the mighty Pennsylvania Railroad in Mount Union. It was here that the ""narrow railroad"" interchanged with the ""Standard Railroad of the World,"" using unique three-rail trackage and its own engines equipped with dual couplers. When the EBT stopped hauling coal in the late 50s, it was not torn up. While waiting for scrap prices to rise, owner Nick Kovalchick and his family became interested in preserving the line. A group of Orbisonia citizens, who wanted to celebrate the settlement's bicentennial, approached the Kovalchick Salvage Company in 1960 about the possibility of reopening a portion of the line. EBT's Operating Vice President C. Roy Wilburn was still on the payroll and, after much hard work and hard cash, the EBT reopened on August 13, 1960 for tourist service over a short section of trackage that ran north out of Orbisonia. Now, the rest is history. The EBT is unique and colorful in many ways. No where else can steam locomotives be found operating over original tracks with their three-way stub switches positioned by Harp switchstands. The Orbisonia shop complex, built after the 1882 fire, is one of the most outstanding examples of steam-powered, beltdriven machinery in America. Along the old line, the rails and bridges are still in place, tunnels wait in empty silence, cars are scattered about the Mount Union yards, and a standard gauge switcher still waits in the old, two-stall enginehouse for the restoration of the entire railroad. The EBT stands today as it did yesterday, unique in the field of historic, authentic narrow gauge railroading in the East.",['Mallory Hope Ferrell'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UoUFAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=UoUFAAAACAAJ&dq=Colorful+East+Broad+Top&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Heimburger House Publishing Company,1995-08-01,http://books.google.nl/books?id=UoUFAAAACAAJ&dq=Colorful+East+Broad+Top&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Transportation'],

ORDINARY JUSTICE.,"""A groundbreaking book . . . revealing the systemic, everyday problems in our courts that must be addressed if justice is truly to be served.""—Doris Kearns Goodwin Attorney and journalist Amy Bach spent eight years investigating the widespread courtroom failures that each day upend lives across America. What she found was an assembly-line approach to justice: a system that rewards mediocre advocacy, bypasses due process, and shortchanges both defendants and victims to keep the court calendar moving. Here is the public defender who pleads most of his clients guilty with scant knowledge about their circumstances; the judge who sets outrageous bail for negligible crimes; the prosecutor who habitually declines to pursue significant cases; the court that works together to achieve a wrongful conviction. Going beyond the usual explanations of bad apples and meager funding, Ordinary Injustice reveals a clubby legal culture of compromise, and shows the tragic consequences that result when communities mistake the rules that lawyers play by for the rule of law. It is time, Bach argues, to institute a new method of checks and balances that will make injustice visible—the first and necessary step to reform.",['Amy Bach'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TGcxvQRT5swC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=TGcxvQRT5swC&printsec=frontcover&dq=ORDINARY+JUSTICE.&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Metropolitan Books,2010-08-03,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TGcxvQRT5swC&source=gbs_api,['Political Science'],5.0

SIGNAL DETECTION & ESTIMATION,"Signal detection theory--as developed in electrical engineering and based on statistical decision theory--was first applied to human sensory discrimination 40 years ago. The theoretical intent was to provide a valid model of the discrimination process; the methodological intent was to provide reliable measures of discrimination acuity in specific sensory tasks. An analytic method of detection theory, called the relative operating characteristic (ROC), can isolate the effect of the placement of the decision criterion, which may be variable and idiosyncratic, so that a pure measure of intrinsic discrimination acuity is obtained. For the past 20 years, ROC analysis has also been used to measure the discrimination acuity or inherent accuracy of a broad range of practical diagnostic systems. It was widely adopted by methodologists in the field of information retrieval, is increasingly used in weather forecasting, and is the generally preferred method in clinical medicine, primarily in radiology. This book attends to both themes, ROC analysis in the psychology laboratory and in practical diagnostic settings, and to their essential unity. The focus of this book is on detection and recognition as fundamental tasks that underlie most complex behaviors. As defined here, they serve to distinguish between two alternative, confusable stimulus categories, which may be perceptual or cognitive categories in the psychology laboratory, or different states of the world in practical diagnostic tasks. This book on signal detection theory in psychology was written by one of the developers of the theory, who co-authored with D.M. Green the classic work published in this area in 1966 (reprinted in 1974 and 1988). This volume reviews the history of the theory in engineering, statistics, and psychology, leading to the separate measurement of the two independent factors in all discrimination tasks, discrimination acuity and decision criterion. It extends the previous book to show how in several areas of psychology--in vigilance and memory--what had been thought to be discrimination effects were, in reality, effects of a changing criterion. The book shows that data plotted in terms of the relative operating characteristic have essentially the same form across the wide range of discrimination tasks in psychology. It develops the implications of this ROC form for measures of discrimination acuity, pointing up the valid ones and identifying several common, but invalid, ones. The area under the binormal ROC is seen to be supported by the data; the popular measures d' and percent correct are not. An appendix describes the best, current programs for fitting ROCs and estimating their parameters, indices, and standard errors. The application of ROC analysis to diagnostic tasks is also described. Diagnostic accuracy in a wide range of tasks can be expressed in terms of the ROC area index. Choosing the appropriate decision criterion for a given diagnostic setting--rather than considering some single criterion to be natural and fixed--has a major impact on the efficacy of a diagnostic process or system. Illustrated here by separate chapters are diagnostic systems in radiology, information retrieval, aptitude testing, survey research, and environments in which imminent dangerous conditions must be detected. Data from weather forecasting, blood testing, and polygraph lie detection are also reported. One of these chapters describes a general approach to enhancing the accuracy of diagnostic systems.",['John A.

Marx's Concept Of Man,"In publishing Marx's Concept of Man in 1961, Erich Fromm presented to the English-speaking world for the first time Karl Marx's then recently discovered Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts. Including the Manuscripts and many other philosophical writings by Marx as well as Fromm's own extended response, many of these writings have since become recognised as important works in their own right. Fromm stresses Marx's humanist philosophy and challenges both contemporary Western ignorance of Marx and Soviet corruptions of his work. Fromm's analysis of Marx's work and his dissemination of these neglected writings by Marx himself fundamentally altered the prevailing discourse about Marxism, revolutionising contemporary thought and providing a formative influence for the development of the New Left.","['Erich Fromm', 'Karl Marx']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=z-5lmQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=z-5lmQEACAAJ&dq=Marx%27s+Concept+Of+Man&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Bloomsbury Academic,2013-12-19,http://books.google.nl/books?id=z-5lmQEACAAJ&dq=Marx%27s+Concept+Of+Man&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Philosophy'],1.0

Motives,"To create a balance between our motives and our goals, we must first learn to recognize the six hidden motives that weaken our ability to succeed. During counseling sessions, Dr. James R. Baugh discovered a correlation between the victimized feelings and behaviors of his clients and their maturity level. In his book, he shows how our internal needs direct our behaviors and motives, and how through maturity we can redirect our motives to achieve our goals. Instead of feeling helpless and out of control, we can bring the six hidden motives into consciousness and learn how to act intentionally instead of habitually. Offering practical lessons to manage your motives and fulfill your goals, Dr. Baugh shows us how to act on our good intentions and lead more satisfying lives.","['Baugh, James R.']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_BEvczmaafMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=_BEvczmaafMC&pg=PA12&dq=Motives&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Pelican Publishing,,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_BEvczmaafMC&source=gbs_api,['Self-Help'],

Que Tal (Spanish Edition),"BESTSELLER #1 DEL NEW YORK TIMES Mark R. Levin, autor seis veces bestseller #1 del New York Times, estrella de Fox News y presentador de radio, regresa para explicar cómo aquellos peligros sobre los que nos advirtió hace una década finalmente han ocurrido…y lo que se debe hacer ahora para hacerlos retroceder. Mark R. Levin movilizó a los conservadores en 2009 con Libertad y tiranía, el cual brindó un marco filosófico, histórico y práctico para detener el ataque liberal contra los valores basados en la Constitución, que hizo su aparición durante los años de Obama. Ese libro hablaba de que estábamos parados frente al precipicio del ataque del progresismo a nuestras libertades, desde la economía hasta la atención médica, y desde el calentamiento global hasta la inmigración. Ahora, más de una década después, hemos ido más allá de ese precipicio…y estamos pagando el precio. En Marxismo norteamericano, Levin explica cómo hoy en día los elementos centrales de la ideología marxista se han generalizado en la sociedad y la cultura estadounidenses—desde nuestras instituciones educativas, la prensa y las corporaciones hasta Hollywood, el partido Demócrata y la presidencia de Biden—y cómo a menudo se la disfraza con rótulos engañosos como “progresismo,” “socialismo democrático,” “activismo social,” y “activismo comunitario”. Con su característico análisis incisivo, Levin se sumerge en la psicología y las tácticas de estos movimientos de masas, el extendido lavado de cerebro de estudiantes, los propósitos antiestadounidenses de la Teoría Crítica de la Raza y del Green New Deal y la escalada de represión y censura para silenciar a voces opositoras e imponer la conformidad. Levin expone a un gran número de instituciones, intelectuales, académicos y activistas que lideran esta revolución, y nos brinda algunas respuestas e ideas sobre cómo confrontarlos. Como escribe Levin: “La contrarrevolución a la Revolución norteamericana está en pleno vigor. Y ya no puede ser desestimada ni ignorada, porque está devorando a nuestra sociedad y a nuestra cultura, rondando en nuestras vidas cotidianas y omnipresente en nuestra política, en nuestras escuelas, en los medios y en la industria del entretenimiento”. Y, tal como hizo antes, Levin busca unir al pueblo estadounidense para que defienda su libertad.",['Mark R.

Bound by Love,"What does it mean to be bound by love? Sometimes, the bonds of love supply bliss, and sometimes they demand sacrifice. Sometimes, experiencing love saves people, and sometimes it kills them. Being bound by love often engenders moral responsibility; in other cases, it enslaves and imprisons the soul. American mythologies—especially those presented in film and television—perpetuate love as the central narrative of one’s life; the search for a connection forged by love permeates every facet of human existence, from our desire to be accepted, or our longing to be needed, to our fury at being rejected. Sometimes love is the stuff of happiness, fulfilling in every regard. But there are also times when love makes us do things we should not do; sometimes it turns us into people we do not want to become. The commonality between love that satisfies and love that destroys is the bond between people who open themselves to the vulnerability of love. Examination of the theme of familial bonds in film and television explores how the process of forming and maintaining those bonds complicates, revises, and reproduces ideas about love. The chapters in this book explore how the nature of bonds and familial responsibility inform a popular cultural dialogue about the changing nature of the American family over the past sixty years.",['Laura Mattoon D’Amore'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=a2ekBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=a2ekBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Bound+by+Love&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Cambridge Scholars Publishing,2011-05-25,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=a2ekBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Performing Arts'],

First Knight: A Novelization,"King Arthur has never been hotter in this steamy, magical, modern-day adventure of witches, wizards, and Bunsen burners! As the Lord of Camelot, it is Arthur's responsibility to protect the witches, wizards, and knights in the castle. But one witch in particular gets under his skin like no other. Morgan never listens, is difficult to control, and impossible to keep off his mind. With pressure mounting for him to take a wife, he sets his sights on a suitable Lady of the Castle. Someone agreeable, demure, and sophisticated. Definitely not a hot-headed scientist who always insists on getting her own way. Once upon a time, Morgan’s powerful intellect was rivaled only by the strength of her magic. But now that her powers have been ripped away, she’s determined to follow her dream of joining a physics research team at the local university. Too bad Camelot is on lock down and the impossible leader of the Round Table is dead set on bringing back the dark ages where witches are concerned. Morgan refuses to bow to the outdated beliefs of her people—she’s a modern woman and won’t be ruled by a man, even if he is sexy and scruffy and good with his sword. When Arthur and Morgan are forced to reevaluate their feelings for one another, will they continue the fabled rivalry of their namesake ancestors? Or will this noble knight and liberated witch discover a happy ending to their age old story? First Knight is the first in a series of modern day retellings of the myths and lore of Camelot. If you like fierce knights who would lay down their lives for their brothers and lose their hearts for their women, then you’ll love the Knights of Caerleon.",['Ines Johnson'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6OuaDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=6OuaDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT1&dq=First+Knight:+A+Novelization&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Those Johnson Girls,2019-05-31,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6OuaDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],
The biography of a grizzly,"First published more than a century ago, The Biography of a Grizzly recounts the life of a fictitious bear named Wahb who lived and died in the Greater Yellowstone region. This new edition combines Ernest Thompson Seton’s classic tale and original illustrations with historical and scientific context for Wahb’s story, providing a thorough understanding of the setting, cultural connections, biology, and ecology of Seton’s best-known book. By the time The Biography of a Grizzly was published in 1900, grizzly bears had been hunted out of much of their historical range in North America. The characterization of Wahb, along with Seton’s other anthropomorphic tales of American wildlife, helped to change public perceptions and promote conservation. As editors Jeremy M. Johnston and Charles R. Preston remind us, however, Seton’s approach to writing about animals put him at the center of the “Nature-Faker” controversy of the early twentieth century, when John Burroughs and Theodore Roosevelt, among others, denounced sentimental representations of wildlife. The editors address conservation scientists’ continuing concerns about inaccurate depictions of nature in popular culture. Despite its anthropomorphism, Seton’s paradoxical book imparts a good deal of insightful and accurate natural history, even as its exaggerations shaped early-twentieth-century public opinion on conservation in often counterproductive ways. By complicating Seton’s enthralling tale with scientific observations of grizzly behavior in the wild, Johnston and Preston evaluate the story’s accuracy and bring the story of Yellowstone grizzlies into the present day. Preserving the 1900 edition’s original design and illustrations, Wahb brings new understanding to an American classic, updating the book for current and future generations.",['Ernest Thompson Seton'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=w09QCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=w09QCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+biography+of+a+grizzly&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,University of Oklahoma Press,2015-07-30,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=w09QCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Nature'],

"Good Food, Served Right : Traditional Recipes and Food Customs from New York's North Country","“The 80 recipes are important, but really, this is a food-studies book written for those who feel some nostalgia for, or connection to, Appalachia.” —Lexington Herald-Leader Mark F. Sohn’s classic book, Mountain Country Cooking, was a James Beard Award nominee in 1997. In Appalachian Home Cooking, Sohn expands and improves upon his earlier work by using his extensive knowledge of cooking to uncover the romantic secrets of Appalachian food, both within and beyond the kitchen. Shedding new light on Appalachia’s food, history, and culture, Sohn offers over eighty classic recipes, as well as photographs, poetry, mail-order sources, information on Appalachian food festivals, a glossary of Appalachian and cooking terms, menus for holidays and seasons, and lists of the top Appalachian foods. Appalachian Home Cooking celebrates mountain food at its best. “When you read these recipes for chicken and dumplings, country ham, fried trout, crackling bread, shuck beans, cheese grits casseroles, bean patties, and sweet potato pie your mouth will begin to water whether or not you have a connection to Appalachia.” —Loyal Jones, author of Appalachian Values “Offers everything you ever wanted to know about culinary mysteries like shucky beans, pawpaws, cushaw squash, and how to season cast-iron cookware.” —Our State “Tells how mountain people have taken what they had to work with, from livestock to produce, and provides more than recipes, but the stories behind the preparing of the food . . .

Social Things: An Introduction to the Sociological Life,"Durkheim's Ghosts is a fascinating presentation of the tradition of social theory influenced by Emile Durkheim's thinking on the social foundations of knowledge. From Saussure and Levi-Strauss to Foucault, Bourdieu and Derrida, today's criticisms of modern politics and culture owe an important, if unacknowledged, debt to Durkheim. These engaging and innovative essays by leading sociologist Charles Lemert bring together his writings on the contributions of French social theory past and present. Rather than merely interpret the theories, Lemert uses them to explore the futures of sociology, social theory, and culture studies. Durkheim's Ghosts offers the reader original insights into Durkheim's legacy and the wider French traditions for the cultural and social sciences. Of special note is the book's new and exciting theory of culture and semiotics. Provocative, scholarly, imaginative and ambitious this book will be invaluable to anyone interested in social theory, culture, and intellectual history of modern times.",['Charles Lemert'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oNNhpfa40MoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=oNNhpfa40MoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Social+Things:+An+Introduction+to+the+Sociological+Life&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Cambridge University Press,2006-02-09,http://books.google.nl/books?id=oNNhpfa40MoC&dq=Social+Things:+An+Introduction+to+the+Sociological+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Social Science'],

"Nearer the Moon: From a Journal of Love : The Unexpurgated Diary of Anais Nin, 1937-1939 (Vol 4)","Anaïs Nin, the diarist, novelist, and provocateur, occupied a singular space in twentieth-century culture, not only as a literary figure and voice of female sexual liberation but as a celebrity and symbol of shifting social mores in postwar America. Before Madonna and her many imitators, there was Nin; yet, until now, there has been no major study of Nin as a celebrity figure. In Writing an Icon, Anita Jarczok reveals how Nin carefully crafted her literary and public personae, which she rewrote and restyled to suit her needs and desires. When the first volume of her diary was published in 1966, Nin became a celebrity, notorious beyond the artistic and literary circles in which she previously had operated. Jarczok examines the ways in which the American media appropriated and deconstructed Nin and analyzes the influence of Nin’s guiding hand in their construction of her public persona. The key to understanding Nin’s celebrity in its shifting forms, Jarczok contends, is the Diary itself, the principal vehicle through which her image has been mediated. Combining the perspectives of narrative and cultural studies, Jarczok traces the trajectory of Nin’s celebrity, the reception of her writings. The result is an innovative investigation of the dynamic relationships of Nin’s writing, identity, public image, and consumer culture.",['Anita Jarczok'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ma_5DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ma_5DQAAQBAJ&pg=PT174&dq=Nearer+the+Moon:+From+a+Journal+of+Love+:+The+Unexpurgated+Diary+of+Anais+Nin,+1937-1939+(Vol+4)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Ohio University Press,2017-02-15,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ma_5DQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Literary Criticism'],

Not Without Laughter,"Langston Hughes’s Not Without Laughter (1930) is drawn in part from the author’s own recollections of youth and early manhood. This stirring coming-of-age tale unfolds in 1930s rural Kansas. A poignant portrait of African-American family life in the early twentieth century, it follows the story of young Sandy Rogers as he grows from a boy to a man. We meet Sandy's mother, Annjee, who works as a housekeeper for a wealthy white family; his strong-willed grandmother, Hager; Jimboy, Sandy's father, who travels the country looking for work; Aunt Tempy, the social climber; and Aunt Harriet, the blues singer who has turned away from her faith. A fascinating chronicle of a family's joys and hardships, ‘Not Without Laughter’ is a vivid exploration of growing up and growing strong in a racially divided society.

Fires (Phoenix Fiction),"She was created to destroy gods, but what happens when she doesn’t live up to the wizards’ expectations?

That is until the elder Wizards in The Guild came to her home with a their vote cast upon her, they could wait no longer for her powers to emerge. They dragged her from her home and into the forbidden Darkan Mountains, a place where even the Elves dare not go. Here Asenten gave her two stones and one order, to go and prove herself. She had never used magic, sure she could talk to the animals, but that wasn’t something that could protect her from the Darkans. Still, they pushed her down the path of fire and ice to a fate worse than hell. She wakes, sleeps, and breathes in darkness, away from prying eyes and the stars she loved so much. They force her to spill the blood of innocents, to torture them, until she feels she is not worthy of anything but pain for all that she has done.

No matter that it will leave KK&C floundering in his wake ...Ruthless in his pursuit of professional success, it doesn't occur to Linc that he himself might be the pawn in this great game of advertising, where no method - be it a calculated office affair or 'disruptive skydiving' - is off limits to aid in selling the dream.In this laugh-out-loud funny and frighteningly believable satire, Hugh Mackay lays bare the machinations of this multi-million-dollar industry, and leaves you wondering just where the line between parody and reality falls.",['Hugh Mackay'],,http://books.google.nl/books?id=72YoswEACAAJ&dq=Selling+The+Dream&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Macmillan,2017-04-26,http://books.google.nl/books?id=72YoswEACAAJ&dq=Selling+The+Dream&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Advertising agencies'],

The Unknown She: Eight Faces of an Emerging Consciousness,"Is there a mystical consciousness particularly natural to women? And if so, what role is it playing in the spiritual evolution of our world? To answer these questions, Hilary Hart traveled across the world meeting with contemporary mystics from a variety of traditions including Lakota Sioux, Sufism, Buddhism, and West-African shamanism. The revelations of feminine wisdom offered from these encounters are not conceptual teachings, but vivid examples of lived spirituality expressed sometimes through simple ways of being, sometimes through profound mystical experiences. Revolutionary and remarkably practical, The Unknown She offers a startling new look at women’s unique mystical orientation and its place in the evolution of our universal consciousness. “... for serious students of mystical traditions and women's spirituality, this challenging book offers rewards not found in more conventional works.” —Publishers Weekly “... a profound exploration of what may become the most important development in the 21st Century: the return of the feminine voice in spiritual experience.” —Tsultrim Allione, author, Women of Wisdom A wonderful book!

"The voice of the Lord: A sermon preached in Christ church, Georgetown, D.C., on the Sunday after the late melancholy catastrophe on board the U.S. steam ship Princeton","Excerpt from The Voice of the Lord: A Sermon Preached in Christ Church, Georgetown, D. C. On the Sunday After the Late Melancholy Catastrophe on Board the U. S. Steam Ship Princeton We are aware of the danger in our way. Our Blessed Savior cautions us against certain inferences which many are too apt to draw from like awful events. Those eighteen, said He on a similar occasion, those eighteen on hom the tower in Siloam fell and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all the men that dwell at Jerusalem? I tell you nay; but except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. We are not permitted to draw any conclusion as to the character or deservings of those who fall in such a calamity. But we are bound to consider such events aswarnings to the living, and to draw such inferences from them as concern ourselves, and are calculated to lead us in the ways of righteousness. And such is the light in which we view the event before us. It is the voice of the Lord to the living. We seem to hear him speaking in it to the nation, to the votaries of pleasure and power, to those im mediately concerned in the accident, to ourselves, in tones of mingled sternness and tenderness, Be still, and know that I am god.

Malden (MA) (Images of America),"This collection of essays presents a sampling of film and television texts, interrogating images of U.S. masculinity. Rather than using “postfeminist” as a definition of contemporary feminism, this collection uses the term to designate the period from the late 1980s on—as a point when feminist thought gradually became more mainstream. The movies and TV series examined here have achieved a level of sustained attention, from critical acclaim, to mass appeal, to cult status. Instead of beginning with a set hypothesis on the effect of the feminist movement on images of masculinity on film and television, these chapters represent a range of responses, that demonstrate how the conversations within these texts about American masculinity are often open-ended, allowing both male characters and male viewers a wider range of options. Defining the relationship between U.S. masculinity and American feminist movements of the twentieth century is a complex undertaking. The essays collected for this volume engage prominent film and television texts that directly interrogate images of U.S. masculinity that have appeared since second-wave feminism. The contributors have chosen textual examples whose protagonists actively struggle with the conflicting messages about masculinity. These protagonists are more often works-in-progress, acknowledging the limits of their negotiations and self-actualization. These chapters also cover a wide range of genres and decades: from action and fantasy to dramas and romantic comedy, from the late 1970s to today. Taken together, the chapters of Screening Images of American Masculinity in the AgeofPostfeminism interrogate “the possible” screened in popular movies and television series, confronting the multiple and competing visions of masculinity not after or beyond feminism but, rather, in its very wake.","['Elizabeth Abele', 'John A.

Surrender Dorothy,"From the New York Times bestselling author Meg Wolitzer, a “devastatingly on target” (Elle) novel about a young woman's accidental death and its effect on her family and friends. For years, Sara Swerdlow was transported by an unfettered sense of immortality. Floating along on loving friendships and the adoration of her mother, Natalie, Sara's notion of death was entirely alien to her existence. But when a summer night's drive out for ice cream ends in tragedy, thirty-year-old Sara—""held aloft and shimmering for years""—finally lands. Mining the intricate relationship between love and mourning, acclaimed novelist Meg Wolitzer explores a single, overriding question: who, finally, ""owns"" the excruciating loss of this young woman—her mother or her closest friends? Depicting the aftermath of Sara's shocking death with piercing humor and shattering realism, Surrender, Dorothy is the luminously thoughtful, deeply moving exploration of what it is to be a mother and a friend, and, above all, what it takes to heal from unthinkable loss.",['Meg Wolitzer'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pTOOoRdcP2AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=pTOOoRdcP2AC&pg=PA237&dq=Surrender+Dorothy&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,2010-08-24,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pTOOoRdcP2AC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],1.0

Reflections on Grief and Spiritual Growth,"Reflections on Grief and Spiritual Growth includes eighteen reflections by Protestant and Catholic writers, creative voices in the Christian community, who reflect on their experiences with grief and loss as a part of their faith journey. Each writer considers such questions as Ø What lessons and wisdom can be shared from his or her personal experiences with grief? Ø In what ways did these losses shape their lives and spiritual journeys? Ø What counsel does our Christian heritage offer us as we grieve the loss of a parent, spouse, child, marriage, job, or health? Ø How has mourning a loss diminished or deepened one's faith? Ø Have spiritual resources been helpful in addressing the anger, guilt and depression that is often a part of the grieving process? Ø Has faith been an asset or not as one faces the increasing and cumulative losses of growing older? Ø Have persons experienced spiritual growth or transformation from traumatic losses? An included study guide helps individuals and groups grapple with the reality of grief and loss in the context of their Christian faith so that we may better learn to grieve as those who have hope.

Beyond the Infinite: The Ascent to Dionysus,"Beyond the Infinite: The Ascent to Dionysus is the first fruit of what Bushashia calls the Post-Scientific Revolution. Bushashia opens with an attack on science's belief in cause and effect, while he puts forth his own anti-causal world-logic, which declares that the world is music. He seeks a world-understanding that not only comes to terms with time, but also fully embraces the becoming nature of actuality. Against both free will and scientific determinism, Bushashia is a fatalist, yet a fatalist who affirms the will-to-power. Against both conservatism and liberalism, Bushashia embarks upon a Dionysian view of life that includes belief in aristocracy. His book also includes new insights into the sublime and the beautiful, a spectacular interpretation of European history, and a strong critique of rationalism. All this is done instructively and with great clarity, making his work a very pleasant and delectable read.",['Adam Bushashia'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cUjMPAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=cUjMPAAACAAJ&dq=Beyond+the+Infinite:+The+Ascent+to+Dionysus&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Publishamerica Incorporated,2004-09,http://books.google.nl/books?id=cUjMPAAACAAJ&dq=Beyond+the+Infinite:+The+Ascent+to+Dionysus&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Philosophy'],

"Torture And Modernity: Self, Society, And State In Modern Iran (Institutional Structures of Feeling)","What does the practice of torture presuppose about human beings and human society? How does one explain a society in which institutional torture persists despite massive changes in government and class structure? What, indeed, are the social foundations of modern torture? In Culture and Modernity, Darius M. Rejali investigates torture in Iran in order to understand and critically reconsider the politics and psychology of modern torture. In a world in which one out of every three governments uses torture, Rejali points to a common past, one shared by Iranians and non-Iranians alike, that supports this practice.“My aim,” Rejali writes, “is to use the study of torture, and of punishment more generally, to unearth deep and important assumptions about society, history, politics, and the ‘good life' that I believe underpin the life of a torturer.”Exploring the four principle explanations of modern torture—those offered by human rights activists, modernization theorists, state terrorist theorists such as Noam Chomsky, and post-structuralists, especially Michel Foucault—Rejali asks, “Do the accounts of political violence that we have developed over the past century have any real… explanatory or even moral significance… in today's world, or are they just consolations in the face of events we cannot fully understand?” His answers lead him to reconsider how Middle Eastern and European history are written and move him to question cherished assumptions about state formation, modernization, and postmodernism. Torture and Modernity is a deeply unsettling book—it contains not only graphic verbal passages, but an extensive photographic essay—yet it is intended to serve as a guide to rethinking current attitudes and reshaping political policies. How people are punished necessarily invokes conceptions of what human beings are and what they might become. A work such as this offers an understanding of what it means to “become modern,” and it is only when this notion of modernity is made manifest and analyzed that one can firmly grasp the prospects for a world without torture.",['Darius M Rejali'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=S5naAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=S5naAAAAMAAJ&q=Torture+And+Modernity:+Self,+Society,+And+State+In+Modern+Iran+(Institutional+Structures+of+Feeling)&dq=Torture+And+Modernity:+Self,+Society,+And+State+In+Modern+Iran+(Institutional+Structures+of+Feeling)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Westview Press,1994,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=S5naAAAAMAAJ&dq=Torture+And+Modernity:+Self,+Society,+And+State+In+Modern+Iran+(Institutional+Structures+of+Feeling)&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Social Science'],1.0

Using an extraordinary array of more than one hundred original documents, he crafts a compelling and comprehensive account of this celebrated year-long protest of racial segregation. Daybreak of Freedom reverberates with the voices of those closest to the bus boycott, ranging from King and his inner circle, to Jo Ann Robinson and other women leaders who started the protest, to the maids, cooks, and other 'foot soldiers' who carried out the struggle.

Did you realize this applies to all aspects of life from work, to family, and even your love life? Maybe you've always believed you weren't great at sports. Or that no one could love you. Research tells us that positive self-talk can change those beliefs and help you become a great athlete or find your soulmate. Ethan Kross' 2014 study on self-talk as a ""regulatory mechanism"" in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology breaks down what happens in your brain with self-talk, from basic to complex decisions. Benjamin Gardner's 2012 research on the habits of the brain (""Making Health Habitual"") in the British Journal of General Practice then reveals the power of habit in the brain, especially when it comes to talking to yourself. Using their research, among others', provides scientific evidence to better explain and give you the tools to change your life. In this guide you'll discover: How to truly love yourself and your body - without committing to a crazy diet or workout program! Where your negative self-talk came from (hint: it's not your fault!) Why the phrase ""you are what you believe"" may be seriously hindering you - but also how it can make you incredibly successful Why athletes, world leaders, and celebrities use visualization every day - and why you should too!

"Strange Power of Speech: Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Literary Possession","This book explores the relationship between tropes of literary property and signification in the writings and literary politics of Wordsworth and Coleridge. Eilenberg argues that a complex of ideas about property, propriety, and possession sets the terms for the two writers' mutually revisionary efforts and informs the images of literary authority, textual identity, and poetic figuration evident in their major works. Eilenberg's readings of the collaboration and its principle texts bring to bear a combination of deconstructive, psychoanalytic, and both new and literary historical methods. The book provides a deeper understanding of the relationship between two of the major figures of English Romanticism as well as fresh insight into what is at stake in the analogy between the verbal and the material or the literary and the economic.",['Susan Eilenberg'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Twiy0tnP8HcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Twiy0tnP8HcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Strange+Power+of+Speech:+Wordsworth,+Coleridge,+and+Literary+Possession&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Oxford University Press,1992-02-27,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Twiy0tnP8HcC&source=gbs_api,['Literary Criticism'],

Peregrine Falcon: Stories of the Blue Meanie (Corrie Herring Hooks Series),"A superb success as a bird, combining great speed, aeronautical grace, and fearlessness...inhabitant of wild places, inaccessible cliffs, and skyscrapers...worldwide dweller, trans-equatorial migrant, and docile captive—the peregrine falcon stands alone among all others of its kind. Perhaps this is why so many varied people rushed to its aid when it faced decimation by pesticide poisoning. In this personal and highly entertaining memoir, Jim Enderson tells stories of a lifetime spent studying, training, breeding, and simply enjoying peregrine falcons. He recalls how his boyhood interest in raptors grew into an ornithological career in which he became one of the leading experts who helped identity DDT as the cause of the peregrine falcon's sudden and massive decline across the United States. His stories reveal both the dedication that he and fellow researchers brought to the task of studying and restoring the peregrine and the hair-raising adventures that sometimes befell them along the way. Enderson also seamlessly weaves in the biology and natural history of the peregrine, as well as anecdotes about its traditional and widespread use in falconry as an aggressive yet tractable hunter, to offer a broad portrait of this splendid and intriguing falcon.",['James H.

Love Song (You're the One! (PB)),"In 1971, Newsweek heralded The Last Picture Show as the ""the most impressive work by a young American director since Citizen Kane."" Indeed, few filmmakers rivaled Peter Bogdanovich's popularity over the next decade. Riding the success of What's Up, Doc? (1972) and Paper Moon (1973), Bogdanovich became a bona fide celebrity, making regular appearances in his own movie trailers, occasionally hosting late-night television shows, and publicly advocating for mentors John Ford and Howard Hawks. No director of his era surpassed his ability to capture an audience's imagination. In Picturing Peter Bogdanovich: My Conversations with the New Hollywood Director, journalist and critic Peter Tonguette offers a film-by-film analysis of the director's life and work. Beginning with a string of 1970s classics, Tonguette explores well-known films such as Saint Jack (1979), They All Laughed (1981), and Noises Off (1992), as well as the director's work on stage and television. Drawing on interviews conducted over sixteen years, Tonguette pairs his analysis with an extensive, previously unpublished series of Q&As with Bogdanovich. These exclusive interviews reveal behind-the-scenes details about the director's life, work, and future plans. Part memoir, part critical biography, this book offers a uniquely intimate portrait of one of Hollywood's most underappreciated directors.",['Peter Tonguette'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BMzcDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=BMzcDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA182&dq=Love+Song+(You%27re+the+One!+(PB))&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,University Press of Kentucky,2020-06-22,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BMzcDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Performing Arts'],

To a Rocky Moon: A Geologist's History of Lunar Exploration,"When human exploration of the lunar surface began in 1969, it marked not only an unprecedented technological achievement but also the culmination of scientific efforts to understand lunar geology. Memoirs of the Apollo astronauts have preserved the exploratory aspects of these missions; now a geologist who was an active participant in the lunar program offers a detailed historical view of those events--including the pre-Apollo era--from a heretofore untold scientific perspective. It was the responsibility of the scientific team of which Don Wilhelms was a member to assemble an overall picture of the Moon's structure and history in order to recommend where on the lunar surface fieldwork should be conducted and samples collected. His book relates the site-selection process in detail, and draws in concomitant events concerning mission operations to show how they affected the course of the scientific program. While discussing all six landings in detail, it tells the behind-the-scenes story of telescopic and spacecraft investigations before, during, and after the manned landings. Intended for anyone interested the space program, the history of science, or the application of geology to planetology, To a Rocky Moon will leave all readers with a better idea of what the Moon is really like. In so expertly summarizing this earlier phase of exploration, it stands as an authoritative touchstone for those involved in the next.",['Don E.

An Acquaintance with Darkness,"A teenage orphan is caught up in President Lincoln’s assassination—and another macabre plot—in this “fast-paced and dramatic” historical novel (Publishers Weekly). Emily’s mother always told her that she should avoid Uncle Valentine, a doctor, that he was involved in things she shouldn’t know about. But after Emily is orphaned—as Washington, DC, is in chaos due to the end of the Civil War—she has nowhere else to go. Now, in addition to coping with the loss of her mother, the fourteen-year-old finds herself involved in two mysteries. First, she wonders about her best friend, Annie Surratt, and the Surratt family. Annie has a signed picture of the handsome actor John Wilkes Booth in her room—but there seems to be more of a connection between Booth and the Surratt family than Emily thought…possibly including the plot to kill Lincoln. At the same time, Uncle Valentine’s odd behavior leads Emily to suspect that he is involved with body-snatching. As dark secrets swirl around her, Emily must figure out who she can trust, in this suspenseful tale “with a wealth of interesting background information” (Publishers Weekly). “Rinaldi has woven two interesting plots here into a fine coming-of-age historical novel....Makes readers feel as if they are living in history.”—Booklist “A vivid account of the moral ambiguities surrounding body snatching—for medical research—at the close of the Civil War.”—Publishers Weekly",['Ann Rinaldi'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=n7pZoaYwIzsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=n7pZoaYwIzsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=An+Acquaintance+with+Darkness&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,2005-03-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=n7pZoaYwIzsC&source=gbs_api,['Young Adult Fiction'],8.0

Asian Religions in Practice: An Introduction (Princeton Readings in Religions),"Princeton Readings in Religions is a new series of anthologies on the religions of the world, representing the significant advances that have been made in the study of religions in the last thirty years. This volume brings together the introductions to the first five volumes of this acclaimed series: Religions of India in Practice (1995), Buddhism in Practice (1995), Religions of China in Practice (1996), Religions of Tibet in Practice (1997), and Religions of Japan in Practice (1999). The introductions to these volumes have been widely praised for their accessible, clear and concise overviews of the religions of Asia, providing both historical context and insightful analysis of Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism, Islam, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Shinto, and Bon, as well as many local traditions. The authors of the chapters are leading scholars of Asian religions: Richard Davis (India), Stephen Teiser (China), George Tanabe (Japan), and Donald Lopez (Buddhism and Tibet). They bring together the best and most current research on their topics, while series editor Donald Lopez provides an introduction to the volume as a whole. In addition to providing a wealth of detail on the history, doctrine, and practice of the religions of Asia, the five chapters offer an opportunity for sustained discussions of the category of ""religion.""",['Donald S.

Best of Bizarro (v. 1),"""Not for the faint of heart or weak of stomach, the 19 stories in this new best-of annual anthology feature episodes of graphic gore and violence—including torture, dismemberment, self-mutilation, and home abortion—that are designed to push buttons as well as boundaries...strictly for hardcore horror fans.""—Publishers Weekly Excerpt from the Introduction: Editors Randy Chandler and Cheryl Mullenax put the call out to horror writers and editors of extreme stories, the hardcore stuff that breaks boundaries and trashes taboos, the transgressive tales you can't ""unread"" (as Chuck Palahniuk says). We staked out our territory and nailed this to the wall to guide us: YEAR'S BEST HARDEST HORROR Not your mama's best-of horror annual. This stuff comes from the edge of the abyss, stories you read at your own risk because you feel the abyss looking right back into you through the tainted lens of each twisted tale. Some of the stories you'll find here are loaded with very graphic descriptions of violence, sex and depravities, while others may contain only one shocking moment of brutality. In others, the hardcore aspect may be less graphic and subtler than you might expect. Some of these quieter tales offer the reader some time to recover from the more disturbing ones preceding. Most of the stories collected here are from small and specialty press anthologies, with a few from periodicals, like the prestigious Splatterpunk Zine in the UK and Thuglit here in the US. Bizarro is also represented with a couple of tales from the unlikely anthology Blood For You: A Literary Tribute To GG Allin from Weirdpunk Books. (If you're not familiar with the late GG Allin, you can find snippets from some of his outrageous and obscene punk shows online, which will increase your appreciation of those two tales.) So for now, forget about that neighbor you suspect is a serial killer, don't worry about the drunk driver that could take you out on your next trip to the store, push those troubling news stories to the back of your mind and immerse yourself in the imaginary horrors at hand. But don't be surprised if you sense something dark staring back at you from between the lines. That is to be expected when you enter these forbidding realms. With any luck, you may find something useful to help you survive the approaching Apocalypse.

Brill Among the Ruins 1ST Edition,"A seminal work in the field of Kurdish studies, Wadie Jwaideh’s pioneering research, published for the first time, presents a detailed analysis of the early phases of Kurdish nationalism and offers a framework within which to understand the movement’s later development. Following Wadie Jwaideh’s dissertation defense, his doctoral chairman took aside Jwaideh’s wife, Alice, and asked her to submit the work for publication without Wadie’s permission, believing that Wadie’s penchant for perfection would postpone its publication indefinitely. The thesis was never published during Jwaideh’s lifetime, but its fame spread by word of mouth, and many scholars have recognized its importance not only as a study of the earlier periods of Kurdish nationalism but also as a model for understanding its subsequent history. The work now stands as a classic, referenced by some of the most renowned scholars in the field. Its publication will permit it to reach a greater audience and to contribute more fully to the understanding and appreciation of this geopolitical and cultural movement. Jwaideh was born in the southern Iraqi city of Basra, into an Arabic-speaking Christian family that later moved to Baghdad. His intimate knowledge of the land and its people gave Jwaideh shrewd insight into Kurdish society and politics. Exploring the rich historical roots of the Kurdish national movement, he challenges the established view of the early Kurdish uprisings as isolated incidents triggered by economic hardship or political dissatisfaction. Instead he offers a new interpretation of the Kurds’ nationalist position, convincingly demonstrating the age and depth of their grievances. This complex and layered history of the Kurdish nationalist movement offers a valuable perspective from which to view the current conditions in Iraq.

Carl F. Gould: A Life in Architecture and the Arts,"Architect Carl F. Gould (1873-1939) was one of the major shapers of modern Seattle. In the early part of the century he was responsible for some of the city’s most distinguished homes and public buildings. He and his partner Charles Herbert Bebb developed the University of Washington campus plan and designed and executed many of its finest buildings, including the renowned Suzzallo Library and the Henry Art Gallery. Gould founded the university’s Department of Architecture; was active in the Washington State Chapter of the American Institute of Architects and the Seattle Fine Arts Society (and its successor the Seattle Art Institute); and was a member of the city’s first planning commission. In this first biography of Gould the architect, teacher, civic leader, and family man, authors T. William Booth and William H. Wilson trace his life and work during almost thirty years of architectural practice in Seattle. Utilizing numerous drawings held in family, university, and Seattle Art Museum collections, the authors explore the full range of Gould’s work, from student Beaux-Arts projects to over 150 extant buildings, and other important though unbuilt projects. Gould’s homes and commercial buildings are profusely illustrated. Booth and Wilson follow the evolution of Gould’s ideas through his publications, lecture notes, correspondence, diaries, speeches, and public activities. Gould moved from New York to Seattle in 1908, when the city was undergoing vigorous expansion in population, industry, and civic awareness. Well traveled and educated, the 34-year-old Gould brought with him a cosmopolitan sensibility, a gregarious nature, a highly developed civic consciousness, and talent. In the first years of his practice, domestic structures in traditional style formed the major portion of his work. His noble interiors, naturally lighted and elegantly proportioned, remain among the most satisfactory of living spaces. Essentially a regionalist and traditionalist in the design of homes, in the last decade of his life Gould embraced modernism for commercial structures. These affirm his skill in utilizing new concepts and materials. His consummate achievement in the modern idiom was the Seattle Art Museum in Volunteer Park. This book explores Gould’s intellectual and aesthetic commitment to ideas he considered essential to the life of architecture. He advocated the concept of beauty as fundamental in architecture, comprising elements of balance, site appropriateness, suitability for the client, generosity of spirit, and a human response of ease and delight in the entire architectural ensemble. Gould worked in the great age of the generalist--he concerned himself with site, landscape, and interior design as well as with the architectural envelope. Throughout his career he searched for elements of an American and regional style. This biography reviews Gould’s life and career, capturing the setting in which he worked and thrived, and the vision and sense of obligation that supported his private and public actions.","['T.

Reptiles and Amphibians of the Amazon: An Ecotourist's Guide,"""The Bartlett's provide a convenient identification guide and reference manual for the reptiles and amphibians most likely to be encountered by visitors to the Amazon basin. It will be of great interest to ecotourists and herpetological hobbyists, and the basic natural history information will be useful to professional biologists who are not specialists in the taxa covered in the book.""--Paul E. Moler, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission Though travel to the Amazon Basin once was accessible only to the most intrepid explorer, today the region is a popular destination for scores of ecotourists, visitors who are likely to observe 50 species of reptiles and amphibians in just a weeklong trip. Until publication of this illustrated field guide, no book has been available to help identify these delightful, stunning, and sometimes venomous creatures. This handbook offers a colorful, easy-to-use guide to more than 250 of the snakes, lizards, turtles, frogs, and salamanders common to the Amazonian regions of Peru, Brazil, Bolivia, and Colombia. From brightly colored frogs so small they fit on a thumbnail to large poisonous snakes camouflaged by green and brown patterned skin, it features all the more frequently seen species as well as types that are less common, and it also provides basic natural history information. Clear close-up photos accompany text that describes appearance, range, size, and color and lists similar species. For many years the authors have led tours to the rainforest. They travel remote rivers on small boats, bunk in tents pitched on sleeping platforms, and walk seldom-trodden trails, usually finding a herpetologic species new to them on each trip. At times, they were hard-pressed to identify the species they photographed; their fellow travelers have found the task even more difficult. For those who want to attach names and information to their natural surroundings, this new field guide will open up the beautiful and mysterious world of herpetofauna. In addition, students of rainforest ecology will find useful information about the infinite variety of rainforest adaptations, and hobbyists will appreciate hard-to-find information about imported specimens. R.D. Bartlett is the author of many books, including In Search of Reptiles and Amphibians and Popular Boas and Pythons, and has published more than 500 articles about herpetology in such magazines as Tropical Fish Hobbyist, Reptiles, and Reptile and Amphibian. Patricia Bartlett is the coauthor with R.D. Bartlett of numerous books, including A Field Guide to Florida Reptiles and Amphibians. Together they have led herpetology photography tours to many areas of the Amazon Basin.","['Richard D.

Dawn on a Distant Shore,"Sara Donati's debut novel, Into the Wilderness, was hailed as ""epic in scope, emotionally intense...an enrapturing, grand adventure"" (BookPage) and ""a captivating saga...definitely the romance of the year when it comes to transcending genre boundaries"" (Booklist). Author Diana Gabaldon called it ""one of those rare stories that let you breathe the air of another time, and leave your footprints on the snow of a wild, strange place."" Now, in her second novel, this award-winning master storyteller once again blends fact and fiction, and re-creates her beloved characters from Into the Wilderness in an eloquent, enthralling tale of romance and adventure. Elizabeth and Nathaniel Bonner have settled into their life together at the edge of the New-York wilderness in the winter of 1794 when Elizabeth gives birth to healthy twins. But soon the events in Canada draw Nathaniel far away from his new family. Word has reached them that Nathaniel's father has been arrested by crown officials in British Canada. Nathaniel reluctantly leaves Hidden Wolf Mountain to set out for the distant city, determined to see his father freed. Instead Nathaniel is imprisoned and finds himself in imminent danger of being hanged as an American spy. In a desperate bid to save her husband, Elizabeth bundles her infants and sets out on the long trek to Montreal. Accompanied by her stepdaughter, Hannah, their wise friend Curiosity Freeman, and Runs-from-Bears, a Mohawk warrior and lifelong friend of Nathaniel's, Elizabeth journeys through the snowy wilderness and across treacherous waterways. But she soon discovers that freeing Nathaniel will take every ounce of her courage and inventiveness. It is a struggle that threatens her with the loss of what she loves most: her children. Torn apart, the Bonners must embark on yet another perilous voyage...this time all the way across the ocean to the heart of Scotland, where a wealthy earl claims kinship with Nathaniel's father, Hawkeye. In his heart, the Mahican tribe of Hawkeye's youth is the truest kin he will ever know, just as Nathaniel will always remain loyal to the Mohawk nation. But with this journey a whole new world opens up to Nathaniel and Elizabeth--and a destiny they could never have imagined awaits them.... A sweeping epic of romance and adventure, Dawn on a Distant Shore establishes Sara Donati as one of today's most gifted storytellers. With well-drawn characters and an evocative love story that is intricately woven into the rich history of our nation's past, this extraordinary novel will enthrall readers like few others--and sweep them away to a whole other time and place.

"Aphoristics : How ""Interesting Ideas"" Turn the World Inside Out","What does it mean to be a gay man living in the suburbs? Do you identify primarily as gay, or suburban, or some combination of the two? For that matter, how does anyone decide what his or her identity is? In this first-ever ethnography of American gay suburbanites, Wayne H. Brekhus demonstrates that who one is depends at least in part on where and when one is. For many urban gay men, being homosexual is key to their identity because they live, work, and socialize in almost exclusively gay circles. Brekhus calls such men ""lifestylers"" or peacocks. Chameleons or ""commuters,"" on the other hand, live and work in conventional suburban settings, but lead intense gay social and sexual lives outside the suburbs. Centaurs, meanwhile, or ""integrators,"" mix typical suburban jobs and homes with low-key gay social and sexual activities. In other words, lifestylers see homosexuality as something you are, commuters as something you do, and integrators as part of yourself. Ultimately, Brekhus shows that lifestyling, commuting, and integrating embody competing identity strategies that occur not only among gay men but across a broad range of social categories. What results, then, is an innovative work that will interest sociologists, psychologists, anthropologists, and students of gay culture.",['Wayne Brekhus'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cMjUnQm3agUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=cMjUnQm3agUC&pg=PA238&dq=Aphoristics+:+How+%22Interesting+Ideas%22+Turn+the+World+Inside+Out&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,University of Chicago Press,2003-10,http://books.google.nl/books?id=cMjUnQm3agUC&dq=Aphoristics+:+How+%22Interesting+Ideas%22+Turn+the+World+Inside+Out&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Psychology'],

Yet despite the formal recognition accorded to Aboriginal and treaty rights at that time, Indigenous peoples continue to argue that they are still being colonized.

She argues that two legal paradigms governed the expansion of the British Empire, one based on popular consent, the other on conquest and the power to command.

The Spiritual Hierarchies and the Physical World: Reality and Illusion,"Ever since nature and consciousness were separated in the late Middle Ages, giving rise to a science of matter alone, the spiritual beings who are the universe have felt abandoned and unable to complete their work, for this work depends for its success on human collaboration. At the same time, human beings have also felt abandoned, condemned to a speck of dust in an infinitely decaying universe. In these remarkable lectures, Rudolf Steiner reestablishes the human being as a participant in an evolving, dynamic universe of living spiritual beings: a living universe, whole and divine. And he does so in concrete images, capable of being grasped by human consciousness as if from within. How is this possible? Implicit in Rudolf Steiner's view is the fact that, fundamentally, the universe consists of consciousness. Everything else is illusion. Hence to understand the evolution of the cosmos and humanity in any terms other than consciousness is also illusion. Whenever we have to do with mighty cosmic facts, we have to do with states of consciousness. But states of consciousness never exist apart from the beings who embody them. Therefore, the only true realities are beings in different states of consciousness. In this sense, Rudolf Steiner's spiritual science is a science of states of consciousness and the beings who embody them. Indeed, rightly considered, all science-physics, chemistry, botany, zoology, geology, psychology, astronomy, etc.-is a science of beings. And the sensory perception, the physical trace, is but the outer vestment of the activity of beings in different states of consciousness. To describe these beings, Steiner uses the names made familiar by the wisdom tradition of the West. He speaks of the evolutionary states of Saturn, Sun, Moon, Earth, Jupiter, Venus, and Vulcan; and the nine ""choirs"" of angels (Seraphim, Cherubim, and Thrones; Dominions, Virtues, and Powers; Principalities, Archangels, and Angels); as well as of elemental beings and nature spirits; and the elements of fire, earth, air, and water.",['Rudolf Steiner'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6CztauLMObkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=6CztauLMObkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Spiritual+Hierarchies+and+the+Physical+World:+Reality+and+Illusion&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,SteinerBooks,2008-08-01,http://books.google.nl/books?id=6CztauLMObkC&dq=The+Spiritual+Hierarchies+and+the+Physical+World:+Reality+and+Illusion&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Education'],

Natural Menopause Remedies: Which Drug-Free Cures Really Work,"Learn the most effective ways to ward off specific menopausal symptoms--without the use of synthetic hormones. We learned the bad news: Women on Hormone Replacement Therapy have a higher risk of heart disease, blood clots, stroke, and breast cancer than those who are not. Some six million women were taking synthetic hormones (HRT) when the news broke. And the Women's Health Initiative, a prestigious, long-term study of 16,000 women, had to stop three years earlier than planned, leaving millions of women unsure what to do next. But there is good news. Women can use all-natural remedies for their hot flashes, insomnia, heart disease, osteoporosis, low libido, and vaginal dryness--without risking serious side effects. Natural Menopause Remedies uncovers the truths and myths about nature's remedies, including foods, herbs, supplements, lifestyle changes, and alternative techniques. Based on clinically proven evidence drawn from thorough research, this book reveals which natural remedies work, how they work, and how to use them. With the information in this book, women can implement a personalized plan for their specific symptoms.",['Nadine Taylor'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Pe-PDnubVr0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Pe-PDnubVr0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Natural+Menopause+Remedies:+Which+Drug-Free+Cures+Really+Work&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2009-12-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Pe-PDnubVr0C&source=gbs_api,['Health & Fitness'],

Classic House-Windy Hill: Ken Tate Architect (The Classic House),"The great estates of the world have frequently been shaped by larger-than-life designers for clients who, themselves, are remarkable personalities. Windy Hill is no exception. Architect Ken Tate was already on the shortlist of preeminent classicists, when Nancy Imes, dynamic matriarch of a banking and media family, asked him to design her new home. Designer Charme Tate's work was appearing regularly in the magazines. Landscape architect Rene Fransen was at work on projects from the glitterati, on the Cote d'Azur and the Hamptons. Client and designers alike were accustomed to defying the status quo in their quest for perfection. As the book reveals, the synthesis of these four astute minds would produce a self-contained world of singular loveliness. In Windy Hill, Graves Nelson, long an eminence grise within the Tates design realm, throws open the estate's great iron gates, and beckons us to enter. Through the eyes of world-class photographers and illustrators, we are privileged to view the private compound of a family whose tastes are erudite and far-ranging.","['Graves Nelson', 'Ken Tate']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=swd5goKoc7kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=swd5goKoc7kC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Classic+House-Windy+Hill:+Ken+Tate+Architect+(The+Classic+House)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Images Publishing,2004,http://books.google.nl/books?id=swd5goKoc7kC&dq=Classic+House-Windy+Hill:+Ken+Tate+Architect+(The+Classic+House)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Architecture'],

"Nietzsche's Corps/e: Aesthetics, Politics, Prophecy, or, the Spectacular Technoculture of Everyday Life (Post-Contemporary Interventions)","Appearing between two historical touchstones—the alleged end of communism and the 100th anniversary of Nietzsche’s death—this book offers a provocative hypothesis about the philosopher’s afterlife and the fate of leftist thought and culture. At issue is the relation of the dead Nietzsche (corpse) and his written work (corpus) to subsequent living Nietzscheanism across the political spectrum, but primarily among a leftist corps that has been programmed and manipulated by concealed dimensions of the philosopher’s thought. If anyone is responsible for what Geoff Waite maintains is the illusory death of communism, it is Nietzsche, the man and concept. Waite advances his argument by bringing Marxist—especially Gramscian and Althusserian—theories to bear on the concept of Nietzsche/anism. But he also goes beyond ideological convictions to explore the vast Nietzschean influence that proliferates throughout the marketplace of contemporary philosophy, political and literary theory, and cultural and technocultural criticism. In light of a philological reconstruction of Nietzsche’s published and unpublished texts, Nietzsche’s Corps/e shuttles between philosophy and everyday popular culture and shows them to be equally significant in their having been influenced by Nietzsche—in however distorted a form and in a way that compromises all of our best interests. Controversial in its “decelebration” of Nietzsche, this remarkable study asks whether the postcontemporary age already upon us will continue to be dominated and oriented by the haunting spectre of Nietzsche’s corps/e. Philosophers, intellectual historians, literary theorists, and those interested in western Marxism, popular culture, Friedrich Nietzsche, and the intersection of French and German thought will find this book both appealing and challenging.",['Geoff Waite'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=otlcb3jYifkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=otlcb3jYifkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Nietzsche%27s+Corps/e:+Aesthetics,+Politics,+Prophecy,+or,+the+Spectacular+Technoculture+of+Everyday+Life+(Post-Contemporary+Interventions)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Duke University Press,1996,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=otlcb3jYifkC&dq=Nietzsche%27s+Corps/e:+Aesthetics,+Politics,+Prophecy,+or,+the+Spectacular+Technoculture+of+Everyday+Life+(Post-Contemporary+Interventions)&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Philosophy'],1.0
Purgatorio,"Climbing out of Hell, Dante in the Purgatorio reaches an island set in the southern ocean. This is Mount Purgatory, where he encounters the penitents who heroically endure their sufferings and speak of their time on Earth. Strange and fresh at every turn, Dante s narrative evokes the mountain landscape in terms of intense physical sensation, right up to the summit. There, before rising to heaven, he enters the Earthly Paradise, where he is movingly reunited with his lost love, Beatrice. This gloriously vivid portrayal of the search for redemption transformed the traditional conception of Purgatory and affirmed the dignity of human will and compassion.",['Dante Alighieri'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vERlAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=vERlAAAAMAAJ&q=Purgatorio&dq=Purgatorio&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin Classics,2007,http://books.google.nl/books?id=vERlAAAAMAAJ&dq=Purgatorio&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Poetry'],

Volcano in My Tummy: Helping Children to Handle Anger,"A Volcano in My Tummy: Helping Children to Handle Anger presents a clear and effective approach to helping children and adults alike understand and deal constructively with children's anger. Using easy to understand yet rarely taught skills for anger management, including how to teach communication of emotions, A Volcano in My Tummy offers engaging, well-organized activities which help to overcome the fear of children's anger which many adult care-givers experience. By carefully distinguishing between anger the feeling, and violence the behavior, this accessible little book, primarily created for ages 6 to thirteen, helps to create an awareness of anger, enabling children to relate creatively and harmoniously at critical stages in their development. Through activities, stories, articles, and games designed to allow a multi-subject, developmental approach to the topic at home and in school, A Volcano in My Tummy gives us the tools we need to put aside our problems with this all-too-often destructive emotion, and to have fun while we're at it. Elaine Whitehouse is a teacher, family court and private psychotherapist, mother of two and leader of parenting skills workshops for eight years. Warwick Pudney is a teacher and counsellor with ten years experience facilitating anger management, abuser therapy and men's change groups, as well as being a father of three.

Sophocles' three-play cycle, chronicling Oedipus's search for the truth and its tragic results, remains essential reading for English and classical studies majors as well as for all students of Western civilization. Oedipus Rex unfolds amid a city in the relentless grip of a plague. When an oracle proclaims that only an act of vengeance will lift the curse from Thebes, King Oedipus vows to bring a murderer to justice. His quest engenders a series of keen dramatic ironies, culminating in the fulfillment of a dreaded prophecy. Oedipus at Colonus finds the former ruler in exile. Old and blind, he seeks a peaceful place to end his torment, but finds only challenges from his reluctant hosts and a summons back to Thebes from his warring sons. The trilogy concludes with Antigone, in which Oedipus's courageous daughter defies her tyrannical uncle in a provocative exploration of the demands of loyalty and duty.",['Sophocles'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ho4wyQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Ho4wyQEACAAJ&dq=The+Theban+Plays:+Oedipus+the+King,+Oedipus+at+Colonus,+Antigone&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Dover Publications,2006-06-23,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Ho4wyQEACAAJ&dq=The+Theban+Plays:+Oedipus+the+King,+Oedipus+at+Colonus,+Antigone&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Drama'],

Er ontsnapte haar een pluk wasgoed. Eén zakdoek zweefde omlaag, het langzaamst van alles, en belandde uiteindelijk op de grond. Als een vogel met half ingevouwen vleugels. Als een ziel die behoedzaam een plek zocht om neer te strijken. Terwijl de verteller met een schrijversbeurs in Warschau verblijft, een besneeuwde stad vol tastbare littekens van het geweld uit het verleden, wordt ze achtervolgd door het verhaal van haar oudere zus, die slechts twee uur na haar geboorte overleed. Een gefragmenteerde verkenning van witte dingen is het resultaat – de bakerdoeken, die ook haar doodskleed waren, de melk uit haar moeders borsten die ze niet meer dronk, de blanco pagina waarop de verteller tevergeefs probeert het verhaal te reconstrueren – alles ontvouwt zich in een krachtig, poëtisch distillaat. Wit is een boek als geen ander. Het zijn gedachten over een kleur, over de kracht en de kwetsbaarheid van de menselijke geest, en pogingen om nieuw leven te vinden in de as van vernietiging. Over De vegetariër: ‘Ik zou zeggen dat u dit boek moet lezen.’ – Arnon Grunberg in de Volkskrant ‘Voor de fans van Murakami.’ **** – Gazet van Antwerpen ‘De vegetariër van Han Kang is een overtuigende, indringende roman.’ – NRC Handelsblad ‘De vegetariër is een wonderlijk boek, schurend en tegelijkertijd diep tragisch en ontroerend.’ – de Volkskrant ‘De bijna perverse verleiding van dit boek zit ’m [...] in de poëzie van de beelden.

Divided by God: America's Church-State Problem--and What We Should Do About It,"A brilliant and urgent appraisal of one of the most profound conflicts of our time Even before George W. Bush gained reelection by wooing religiously devout ""values voters,"" it was clear that church-state matters in the United States had reached a crisis. With Divided by God, Noah Feldman shows that the crisis is as old as this country--and looks to our nation's past to show how it might be resolved. Today more than ever, ours is a religiously diverse society: Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist as well as Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish. And yet more than ever, committed Christians are making themselves felt in politics and culture. What are the implications of this paradox? To answer this question, Feldman makes clear that again and again in our nation's history diversity has forced us to redraw the lines in the church-state divide. In vivid, dramatic chapters, he describes how we as a people have resolved conflicts over the Bible, the Pledge of Allegiance, and the teaching of evolution through appeals to shared values of liberty, equality, and freedom of conscience. And he proposes a brilliant solution to our current crisis, one that honors our religious diversity while respecting the long-held conviction that religion and state should not mix. Divided by God speaks to the headlines, even as it tells the story of a long-running conflict that has made the American people who we are.",['Noah Feldman'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RlVdhLejODcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=RlVdhLejODcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Divided+by+God:+America%27s+Church-State+Problem--and+What+We+Should+Do+About+It&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,"Farrar, Straus and Giroux",2007-05-15,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RlVdhLejODcC&source=gbs_api,['Political Science'],

Satires and epistles,"Exuberantly mocking the vices and pretensions of his Roman contemporaries, Horace's Satires are stuffed full of comic vignettes, moral insights, and his pervasive humanity. Boasting famous episodes such as the fable of the town mouse and the country mouse and the grotesque dinner party given by the nouveau-riche Nasidienus, these poems influenced not only contemporaries such as Juvenal, but also English satirists from Ben Jonson to W. H. Auden. In the Epistles, Horace used the form of letters to explore questions of philosophy and how to live a good life. Perhaps the best-known epistle, ""The Art of Poetry"" (Ars poetica), still influences the work of writers today. These new prose translations by John Davie perfectly capture the lively, scurrilous, and frequently hilarious style of the satires, and the warm and engaging persona of the more meditative epistles. Robert Cowan's introduction and notes take account of the latest scholarship, placing Horace's poems within the development of Roman satire, and exploring the themes of philosophy, morality, sex and gender, literary criticism, politics, and patronage. About the Series: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.","['Horace,', 'Quintus Horatius Flaccus']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_L8OVWHuB-4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=_L8OVWHuB-4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Satires+and+epistles&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Oxford University Press,2011-04-14,http://books.google.nl/books?id=_L8OVWHuB-4C&dq=Satires+and+epistles&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Literary Collections'],

The Letter Writer,"This study argues for new perspectives on the letters of Paul, especially the Second Letter to Timothy. It examines striking aspects of Paul's letters, especially the fact that many of them are co-authored, that six of them acknowledge that a secretary has penned the letter, and that 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy and Titus are the only ones addressed to individuals. It investigates the implications of these facts for the concept of Pauline authorship. Prior maintains that the received arguments, statistical as well as literary, which exclude 2 Timothy from the influence of Paul, are less than convincing. The author suggests an original reading of 2 Timothy arguing it was composed by Paul towards the end of his first Roman imprisonment. Contrary to all interpretations of the letter which argue that Paul was about to be martyred, Prior claims that Paul was confident that he would be released, and was assembling a mission team to bring his proclamation of the Gospel to a completion. Timothy's courage and missionary zeal needed rekindling, for he and Mark were to be key figures in this new team.",['Michael Prior'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ntnUAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=ntnUAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Letter+Writer&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,A&C Black,1989-01-01,http://books.google.nl/books?id=ntnUAwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Letter+Writer&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Bible'],

Bruce Di Marsico Presents the Option Method,"The Option Method: The Myth of Unhappiness, Vol. 2 is the second of a three-volume set subtitled The Collected Works of Bruce Di Marsico on The Option Method and Attitude. Following the introductory Volume 1, Volume 2 delves deeper into the nature of happiness and unhappiness in nine parts: Feelings, Beliefs and Desires; Emotions; What Moves Us; Motivation; Wanting, Doing and Knowing; Relationships; Believing Yourself; Forms of Unhappiness and Arguments Against Happiness. The book focuses on more intermediate Option Method concepts in 118 chapters such as Believing as a Biological Reality, Wanting to be Unhappy to the Right Degree, Beliefs are Known as the Truth and Pain and Unhappiness. The work continues to shine the light on the words of this remarkable man, who tells us ""Happiness is not hiding, nor is it elusive; it is the most present, most obvious reality."" A powerful tool for happiness, The Option Method is based on the premise that happiness is our natural state and all unhappiness is based on the belief that we have to be unhappy. A precursor to new age personal growth and development tools, today The Option Method is practiced the world over. Bruce Di Marsico (1942-1995)left behind a rich legacy of his voluminous writings on the nature of happiness and unhappiness and his blueprint for achieving happiness through The Option Method. Until now, these writings were not widely available. Lovingly compiled by Di Marsico's widow, Deborah Mendel, with edits and commentary by Aryeh Nielsen, Option Method scholar.

Overlanding,"An unforgettable trek through Africa based on the author’s real-life experiences blends realities of nature and spiritualism in a fascinating novel. Overlanding tells of the amazing adventure of two culturally different young women bound on a near-impossible trek through Africa in the early '70's. It evokes a real, if (today) elusive Africa—its people, its magic, its wildlife—with all the mystery of that astonishing continent. When Kate, an impulsive young American traveller, meets Zaleka, a young Zulu girl with a wealth of cultural knowledge and a heart for adventure, an instant friendship turns into the voyage of a lifetime. Zaleka, a recent graduate, is still feeling uncertain about having to immediately consider a lifelong commitment to her hereditary role as a Sangoma, a traditional tribal healer and spiritual guide. Kate, just on the cusp of entering college, is also grappling with her future path in Ethology and seeks to increase her knowledge of animals in the wild as an aid to her in future studies. With each girl on her own journey of self-discovery, Kate and Zaleka soon find themselves sharply challenged by the realities of solo land travel through the African Continent. They discover they must truly rely upon each other if they wish to survive the harsh environment, the wild animals, medical emergencies, vehicle breakdowns, marauders, and lawmen alike—yet, undeterred, they plunge on. Every page provides a feeling of being 'right-beside-Kate-and-Zaleka'. The novel engages the reader into being there as a part in their resolution of varied, and often complex, issues. It also allows the reader to share the joy of their trusting companionship and their exhilaration in travel and discovery.",['Sue G.

Untitled Epic Poem on the History of Industrialization,"Jonathan Williams and Fuller became friends at Black Mountain College in North Carolina in the 1930s. Williams was delighted when in 1962 Fuller offered him a grant to help bring out this long poem in the Jargon Press series. Williams knew nothing about the concurrent Simon and Schuster edition until some years later when he came across a copy in a bookstore. Given Fuller’s casual approach to the publishing process this kind of funny coincidence was not unusual. Russell Davenport was an editor at Fortune magazine during the period from 1938 to 1940 when Fuller was a consultant. (Davenport was later national campaign manager for Wendell Willkie in the Republican campaign of 1940.) Almost buried on the back of the folded inside flap copy of the Jargon edition is Fuller’s statement that he and Davenport closely collaborated on the Industrialization piece: “About 10 percent of the wording was Davenport’s” and “... neither of us ever hoped it would find a publisher.” In the introduction Davenport describes Fuller as “not a poet in words” but “a poet in science,” and he had once described Fuller in Fortune as “the first poet of industrialization.” Hugh Kenner has characterized this anthem to American industry as “our only readable didactic poem.” Description by Ed Applewhite, courtesy of The Estate of Buckminster Fuller",['R.

Polymath,"Every human is born with multifarious potential. Why, then, do parents, schools and employers insist that we restrict our many talents and interests; that we 'specialise' in just one? We've been sold a myth, that to 'specialise' is the only way to pursue truth, identity, or even a livelihood. Yet specialisation is nothing but an outdated system that fosters ignorance, exploitation and disillusionment and thwarts creativity, opportunity and progress. Following a series of exchanges with the world’s greatest historians, futurists, philosophers and scientists, Waqas Ahmed has weaved together a narrative of history and a vision for the future that seeks to disrupt this prevailing system of unwarranted ‘hyper-specialisation.’ In The Polymath, Waqas shows us that there is another way of thinking and being. Through an approach that is both philosophical and practical, he sets out a cognitive journey towards reclaiming your innate polymathic state. Going further, he proposes nothing less than a cultural revolution in our education and professional structures, whereby everyone is encouraged to express themselves in multiple ways and fulfil their many-sided potential. Not only does this enhance individual fulfilment, but in doing so, facilitates a conscious and creative society that is both highly motivated and well equipped to address the complexity of 21st century challenges.",['Waqas Ahmed'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N5RxDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=N5RxDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Polymath&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Wiley,2018-11-19,http://books.google.nl/books?id=N5RxDwAAQBAJ&dq=Polymath&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],3.0

But was Troy an actual place or just a legend of Homer's epic? It took the most unlikely of people, Heinrich Schliemann--a grocer's-apprentice turned self-made archaeologist, courageous and driven--to solve one of the greatest puzzles in history. His extraordinary discovery of the ruins of fabled Troy and the magnificent treasure of King Priam anointed Schliemann as the 'father of pre-history', but was also beset by controversy that persists to this day. The fate of the treasure itself is no less troubled. In 1945 it was spirited out of Berlin by the Red Army, to be hidden for 50 years in the vaults of the Pushkin Museum until the breakup of the Soviet Union. In this fast-paced account, Caroline Moorehead describes one of the most remarkable adventures of the 20th century, tracing Schliemann's footsteps to Troy and the convoluted journey across Europe taken by the treasure itself.

I Might Just Be Right,"""Meek shares one important trait with (Ernie) Pyle. He tells good stories. To me that is the highest praise a writer can receive."" Jim Kiser, Arizona Daily Star People who have known John Martin Meek know he has never been reluctant to express his opinions with one regrettable exception. In the Cabinet Room of the White House one evening, President Johnson went around the table to ask all present what he or she thought about the Vietnam War. To his deep regret, Meek failed to tell LBJ he honestly felt the war was going to destroy his presidency. But by then the president was getting the same advice from The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King and other distinguished Americans. Moving from Washington, DC, to Southern Arizona in 1999, Meek began teaching journalism at Pima Community College (60,000 students) in Tucson and jumpstarted his journalism career by writing features and all but two of the columns included in this book. After leaving the University of Oklahoma journalism school, where he was editor of The Oklahoma Daily, Meek worked on newspapers in Texas and New York while earning an MA in communications at Syracuse University. He then had a long and, to him, exciting career in political and private sector public affairs in New York, Chicago and primarily in Washington, DC. He has drawn from these experiences for some of the columns in this book. Meek, writing under the pen name of John Martin Hill, is the author of ""The Christmas Hour"" (www.thechristmashour.com), a novel set in Washington, DC, and editor of a book of photos of the Johnson presidency.",['John Martin Meek'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9kEAsnfzdSkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=9kEAsnfzdSkC&pg=PA107&dq=I+Might+Just+Be+Right&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Xlibris Corporation,2005-11-07,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9kEAsnfzdSkC&source=gbs_api,['Social Science'],

Portraits from Memory and Other Essays,"‘I have come to think that one of the main causes of trouble in the world is dogmatic and fanatical belief in some doctrine for which there is no adequate evidence.’ – Bertrand Russell, Portraits from Memory Portraits from Memory is one of Bertrand Russell’s most self-reflective and engaging books. Whilst not intended as an autobiography, it is a vivid recollection of some of his celebrated contemporaries, such as George Bernard Shaw, Sidney and Beatrice Webb and D. H. Lawrence. Russell provides some arresting and sometimes amusing insights into writers with whom he corresponded. He was fascinated by Joseph Conrad, with whom he formed a strong emotional bond, writing that his Heart of Darkness was not just a story but an expression of Conrad’s ‘philosophy of life’. There are also some typically pithy Russellian observations; H. G. Wells ‘derived his importance from quantity rather than quality’, whilst after a brief and fraught friendship Russell thought D. H. Lawrence ‘had no real wish to make the world better, but only to indulge in eloquent soliloquy about how bad it was’. This engaging book also includes some of Russell’s customary razor-sharp essays on a rich array of subjects, from his ardent pacifism, liberal politics and morality to the ethics of education, the skills of good writing and how he came to philosophy as a young man. These include ‘A Plea for Clear Thinking’, ‘A Philosophy for Our Time’ and ‘How I Write’. Portraits from Memory is Russell at his best and will enthrall those new to Russell as well as those already well-acquainted with his work.

In The Break: The Aesthetics Of The Black Radical Tradition,"Investigates the connections between jazz, sexual identity, and radical black politics In his controversial essay on white jazz musician Burton Greene, Amiri Baraka asserted that jazz was exclusively an African American art form and explicitly fused the idea of a black aesthetic with radical political traditions of the African diaspora. In the Break is an extended riff on “The Burton Greene Affair,” exploring the tangled relationship between black avant-garde in music and literature in the 1950s and 1960s, the emergence of a distinct form of black cultural nationalism, and the complex engagement with and disavowal of homoeroticism that bridges the two. Fred Moten focuses in particular on the brilliant improvisatory jazz of John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, Albert Ayler, Eric Dolphy, Charles Mingus, and others, arguing that all black performance—culture, politics, sexuality, identity, and blackness itself—is improvisation. For Moten, improvisation provides a unique epistemological standpoint from which to investigate the provocative connections between black aesthetics and Western philosophy. He engages in a strenuous critical analysis of Western philosophy (Heidegger, Kant, Husserl, Wittgenstein, and Derrida) through the prism of radical black thought and culture. As the critical, lyrical, and disruptive performance of the human, Moten’s concept of blackness also brings such figures as Frederick Douglass and Karl Marx, Cecil Taylor and Samuel R. Delany, Billie Holiday and William Shakespeare into conversation with each other. Stylistically brilliant and challenging, much like the music he writes about, Moten’s wide-ranging discussion embraces a variety of disciplines—semiotics, deconstruction, genre theory, social history, and psychoanalysis—to understand the politicized sexuality, particularly homoeroticism, underpinning black radicalism. In the Break is the inaugural volume in Moten’s ambitious intellectual project-to establish an aesthetic genealogy of the black radical tradition",['Fred Moten'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=56Aq-3kRKnAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=56Aq-3kRKnAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=In+The+Break:+The+Aesthetics+Of+The+Black+Radical+Tradition&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,U of Minnesota Press,2003-04-09,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=56Aq-3kRKnAC&source=gbs_api,['Music'],

Reality,"Is knowledge discovered, or just invented? Can we ever get outside ourselves to know how reality is in itself, independent of us? Philosophical realism raises the question whether in our knowing we connect with an independent reality--or only connect with our own mental constructs. Far from being a silly parlor game, the question impacts our lives concretely and deeply. Modern Western culture has been infected with antirealism and the doubt, skepticism, subjectivism, relativism, and atheism that attends it--not to mention distrust and arbitrary (mis)use of reality. Premier scientist-turned-philosopher Michael Polanyi stepped aside from research to offer an innovative account of knowing that takes its cue from how discovery actually happens. Polanyi defied the antirealism of the twentieth century, sounding a ringing note of hope in his repeated claim that in discovery, we know we have made contact with reality because ""we have a sense of the possibility of indeterminate future manifestations."" And that sense marks contact with reality, because it is the way reality is: abundant, generous, and fraught with as-yet-unnameable possibilities. This book examines that distinctive claim, contrasting it to the wider philosophical discussions regarding realism and antirealism in the recent decades. It shows why Polanyi's outlook is superior, and why that matters, not just to scientific discoverers, but to us all.",['Esther Lightcap Meek'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XI0mDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=XI0mDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT96&dq=Reality&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2017-05-05,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XI0mDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Philosophy'],
The Far Islands and Other Cold Places: Travel Essays of a Victorian Lady,"Elizabeth Taylor (1856 - 1932) was a travel writer entranced by the Northern climes.

All That Glitters,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • In Danielle Steel’s dazzling new novel, a young woman must overcome tremendous adversity in her quest to find herself and achieve real happiness. Nicole “Coco” Martin is destined to have it all. As the only child of doting and successful parents, she has been given every opportunity in life. Having inherited her mother’s stunning beauty and creativity, along with her father’s work ethic and diligence, she has the world at her feet. Her graduation from Columbia is fast approaching, and with it the summer job of her dreams working at a magazine. Between work, leisurely weekends at her family’s home in Southampton, and spending as much time as possible with her best friend, Sam, life couldn’t be better—until tragedy strikes. Coco’s beloved parents are killed in a terrorist attack while on vacation in France. Now devastated and alone, Coco must find a way to move forward and make her way in the world without the family she loved. Determined to forge her own path and make her parents proud, Coco pursues her dreams, dazzled by exciting opportunities that come her way. Her goals are to think outside the box—and always play by her own rules. As she finds herself drawn to charismatic, fascinating men, each relationship will teach Coco new lessons, some delightful, some painful. She will come to realize what matters, and how strong she truly is—and in the end, she will discover herself. Richly exploring one woman’s poignant journey through life, All That Glitters is a compelling tale of challenges, heartbreak, discovery, and triumph, a powerful reminder that all that glitters is not the essence of life. And what is truly worth having was right there in our hands all along.",['Danielle Steel'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YjHMDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=YjHMDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=All+That+Glitters&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Dell,2020-11-17,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YjHMDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],3.0
Lavender Culture,"The influence of gays and lesbians on language, literature, theater, poetry, dance, music, and the arts is unmeasurable. In the era before AIDS, gay and lesbian culture had a defining, if unrecognized, influence on American life, an influence that is only now being acknowledged. This reissue of the classic anthology, Lavender Culture, serves as a provocative, dynamic, and wide-ranging reminder of American gay and lesbian culture in the days before the status of gay people received widespread attention in the media, religion, and politics, before Newsweek saw it fit to feature a cover story on LESBIANS, and before gays and lesbians took center stage in America's cultural landscape. Here we find the young, assertive voices of such activists, authors, and artists as Rita Mae Brown, Barbara Grier, John Stoltenberg, Julia Penelope, Andrea Dworkin, Andrew Kopkind, Jane Rule, Arthur Bell, Charlotte Bunche, and dozens more. Including essays on such diverse subjects as gay bath houses, the gay male image in classical ballet, images of gays in rock music, Judy Garland, lesbian humor, sports and machismo, the growing business of women's music, and the Cleveland bar scene in the 1940s, Lavender Culture, with new introductory essays by the editors and Cindy Patton, offers a panoply of gay and lesbian life, tracing the current influence and visibility of gay and lesbian culture back to its origins.","['Karla Jay', 'Allen Young']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Hkg9DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Hkg9DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Lavender+Culture&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,NYU Press,1994-11,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Hkg9DAAAQBAJ&dq=Lavender+Culture&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Social Science'],
What Women Watched: Daytime Television in the 1950s (Louann Atkins Temple Women & Culture Series),"In this pathfinding book, based on original archival research, Marsha F. Cassidy offers the first thorough analysis of daytime television's earliest and most significant women's genres, appraising from a feminist perspective what women watched before soap opera rose to prominence. After providing a comprehensive history of the early days of women's programming across the nation, Cassidy offers a critical discussion of the formats, programs, and celebrities that launched daytime TV in America—Kate Smith's variety show and the famed singer's unsuccessful transition from patriotic radio star to 1950s TV idol; the ""charm boys"" Garry Moore, Arthur Godfrey, and Art Linkletter, whose programs honored women's participation but in the process established the dominance of male hosts on TV; and the ""misery shows"" Strike It Rich and Glamour Girl and the controversy, both critical and legal, they stirred up. Cassidy then turns to NBC's Home show, starring the urbane Arlene Francis, who infused the homemaking format with Manhattan sophistication, and the ambitious daily anthology drama Matinee Theater, which strove to differentiate itself from soap opera and become a national theater of the air. She concludes with an analysis of four popular audience participation shows of the era—the runaway hit Queen for a Day; Ralph Edwards's daytime show of surprises, It Could Be You; Who Do You Trust?, starring a youthful Johnny Carson; and The Big Payoff, featuring Bess Myerson, the country's first Jewish Miss America. Cassidy's close feminist reading of these shows clearly demonstrates how daytime TV mirrored the cultural pressures, inconsistencies, and ambiguities of the postwar era.",['Marsha F.

It follows the narrative of a man who witnessed it from the beginning, always in the center of the action. When the war broke out in April 1861, G. Moxley Sorrel worked as a bank clerk in Savannah. He left this job to watch Fort Sumter fall, then offered his services to the new Confederacy. He found himself working as a staff officer for James Longstreet, then a brigade commander, in no time. It was the start of a long and beneficial partnership that lasted till the war's end. Published posthumously, this work comprises vivid descriptions of his thrilling experiences.

Nostromo,"Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of all time Originally published in 1904, Nostromo is considered by many to be Conrad's supreme achievement. Set in the imaginary South American republic of Costaguana, the novel reveals the effects of unbridled greed and imperialist interests on many different lives. Although each character's potential for good is ultimately corrupted, Nostromo underscores Conrad's belief in fidelity, moral discipline, and the need for human communion. The author himself described the book as 'an intense creative effort on what I suppose will remain my largest canvas.' 'Conrad endeavored to create a great, massive, multiphase symbol that would render his total vision of the world, his sense of individual destiny, his sense of man's place in nature, his sense of history and society,' observed Robert Penn Warren. 'Nostromo is the most strikingly modern of Conrad's novels,' said V. S. Pritchett. 'It is pervaded by a profound, even morbid sense of insecurity which is the very spirit of our age.'

"Contra Keynes and Cambridge: Essays, Correspondence (The Collected Works of F. A. Hayek, Vol 9)","Friedrich A. Hayek is regarded as one of the preeminent economic theorists of the twentieth century, as much for his work outside of economics as for his work within it. During a career spanning several decades, he made contributions in fields as diverse as psychology, political philosophy, the history of ideas, and the methodology of the social sciences. Bruce Caldwell—editor of The Collected Works of F. A. Hayek—understands Hayek's thought like few others, and with this book he offers us the first full intellectual biography of this pivotal social theorist. Caldwell begins by providing the necessary background for understanding Hayek's thought, tracing the emergence, in fin-de-siècle Vienna, of the Austrian school of economics—a distinctive analysis forged in the midst of contending schools of thought. In the second part of the book, Caldwell follows the path by which Hayek, beginning from the standard Austrian assumptions, gradually developed his unique perspective on not only economics but a broad range of social phenomena. In the third part, Caldwell offers both an assessment of Hayek's arguments and, in an epilogue, an insightful estimation of how Hayek's insights can help us to clarify and reexamine changes in the field of economics during the twentieth century. As Hayek's ideas matured, he became increasingly critical of developments within mainstream economics: his works grew increasingly contrarian and evolved in striking—and sometimes seemingly contradictory—ways. Caldwell is ideally suited to explain the complex evolution of Hayek's thought, and his analysis here is nothing short of brilliant, impressively situating Hayek in a broader intellectual context, unpacking the often difficult turns in his thinking, and showing how his economic ideas came to inform his ideas on the other social sciences. Hayek's Challenge will be received as one of the most important works published on this thinker in recent decades.",['Bruce Caldwell'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sNXdj6A0CYcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=sNXdj6A0CYcC&pg=PA452&dq=Contra+Keynes+and+Cambridge:+Essays,+Correspondence+(The+Collected+Works+of+F.+A.+Hayek,+Vol+9)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",University of Chicago Press,2008-12-05,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sNXdj6A0CYcC&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],1.0

Angry People: ...and What We Can Learn from Them (Living Lessons from God's Word),"What do Moses, King David, the prophet Jonah, and Jesus Christ have in common? According to Scripture, they all experienced anger. Some experienced righteous anger; for others, their anger was sinful.

Using Scripture as his springboard, he examines anger in all its forms, showing how it worked for good or bad in the lives of some of the Bible's most notorious--and righteous--people. As they learn about Elisha, Uzziah, and others who felt the fire of anger, readers will gain a new understanding of how to control this force and use it the way God intended.

How to Develop a Strategic Marketing Plan: A Step-By-Step Guide,"Two-thirds of rapid-growth firms use written business plans, according to Price, Waterhouse, Coopers 1998 Trendsetter Barometer. The survey also states that firms with written plans grow faster, achieve a higher proportion of revenues from new products and services, and enable CEOs to manage more critical business functions. How to Develop a Strategic Marketing Plan is both innovative and pragmatic in its approach. It explains how to combine the strategic vision of long-term business planning with the action-oriented thrust of a short-term marketing plan. Planning forms and guidelines for customizing your own Strategic Market Plan (SMP) are available for download from the CRC Press website. Just go to the download tab located with the book's description.Actual case histories - from companies such as Campbell Soup, Co., Texas Instruments, Inc., and Quaker State Corp. - illustrate how business-building opportunities translate into strategies and tactics. They demonstrate the compelling relationship between internal organizational functions and external market conditions, the long- and short-term strategic marketing issues and the advantages of developing an SMP.Strategic market planning shapes the future of business. In its broadest dimension it sets in motion actions that impact long term prosperity.

The Bible Made Easy: A Book-by-book Introduction,"The purpose of this book is to introduce you to the amazing literature of the Bible. —From the Introduction The Bible can be intimidating. This is as true for seasoned biblical scholars as it is for first-time readers.

He offers a quick introduction to each of these books that highlights the main characters, the great themes, the central questions and the spiritual lessons. With questions for reflection, helpful sidebars and a timeline of biblical events, this volume is an indispensable roadmap (with a few handy shortcuts) for those setting upon the journey through our most important book.",['Timothy Schehr'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xkmjAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=xkmjAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Bible+Made+Easy:+A+Book-by-book+Introduction&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Franciscan Media,2006,http://books.google.nl/books?id=xkmjAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Bible+Made+Easy:+A+Book-by-book+Introduction&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],

EXPENDABLE.,"“It was surprising what old experiences remembered could do to a presumably educated, civilized man.” And Hugh Denismore, a young doctor driving his mother’s Cadillac from Los Angeles to Phoenix, is eminently educated and civilized. He is privileged, would seem to have the world at his feet, even. Then why does the sight of a few redneck teenagers disconcert him? Why is he reluctant to pick up a disheveled girl hitchhiking along the desert highway? And why is he the first person the police suspect when she is found dead in Arizona a few days later? Dorothy B. Hughes ranks with Raymond Chandler and Patricia Highsmith as a master of mid-century noir. In books like In a Lonely Place and Ride the Pink Horse she exposed a seething discontent underneath the veneer of twentieth-century prosperity. With The Expendable Man, first published in 1963, Hughes upends the conventions of the wrong-man narrative to deliver a story that engages readers even as it implicates them in the greatest of all American crimes.",['Dorothy B.

The Art of Sufi Healing,"In ""The Art of Sufi Healing"", the author blends the ancient mystical tradition of Sufism with the latest mind/body research to foster personal transformation and healthy living. The concepts of Sufi healing are based on 1,400 years of successful experience in working with the physical and metaphysical aspects of the human being and include a strong emphasis on the electromagnetic fields of the body. The reader is led through the empowering awareness of self love and self knowledge towards methods of enhancing the healing pathways and understanding the human energy system. Specific meditations, involving the breath, light, intentions, and spiritual principles, provide a treasury of practices, perspectives and wisdom of the healing heart. The power of the mind, heart and expanded consciousness knows no limit in creating health and healing. Both the layperson and the health care professional are offered exciting new concepts and techniques for healing. Perhaps the remedy to the health care crisis does not lie in amending the system, but in redirecting our thinking to reflect a whole new approach. Instead of focusing on the ""disease model"", ""The Art of Sufi Healing"", proposes a positive new health paradigm, by awakening the reader to their inherent potentials and possibilities.","[""Linda O'Riordan""]",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xRoJAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=xRoJAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Art+of+Sufi+Healing&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,M T O Publications Center,1999,http://books.google.nl/books?id=xRoJAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Art+of+Sufi+Healing&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Health & Fitness'],

Understanding Beth Henley (Understanding Contemporary American Literature),"Beth Henley remains best known for Crimes of the Heart, a play that won the Pulitzer Prize and the New York Drama Critics Circle Award and later was made into a major motion picture. In this introduction to the Mississippi-born playwright and her body of work, Robert J. Andreach presents Henley's plays as a unified whole, considering both her more accessible work of the 1980s and the commonly misunderstood--and often overlooked--plays of the 1990s. Andreach fills the gap in scholarship about the later plays and, in doing so, argues that they recast familiar themes, images, and motifs into new modes of self-discovery and expression. Andreach concedes that differences in setting and style separate the two decades of Henley's career: the plays from the earlier decade comprise single, representational sets in the Deep South of Mississippi and Louisiana while the plays from the 1990s are multiple, symbolic sets in Southern California and other locations. He contends, however, that whether dramatizing naturalistically or experimentally, Henley does not stray far from her original concerns. Andreach points out that while the self-discoveries of the two decades differ, Henley's goal is the same: characters who prove themselves worthy in a culture that denigrates them.Andreach's analysis features close readings of Henley's entire corpus. He positions her final three works of the 1990s as a trilogy that reconciles differing modes of self-discovery.","['Robert J. Andreach', 'Robert J..

Intercollegiate Athletics and the American University: A University President's Perspective,"After decades of domination on campus, college sports' supremacy has begun to weaken. ""Enough, already!"" detractors cry. College is about learning, not chasing a ball around to the whir of TV cameras. In Intercollegiate Athletics and the American University James Duderstadt agrees, taking the view that the increased commercialization of intercollegiate athletics endangers our universities and their primary goal, academics. Calling it a ""corrosive example of entertainment culture"" during an interview with ESPN's Bob Ley, Duderstadt suggested that college basketball, for example, ""imposes on the university an alien set of values, a culture that really is not conducive to the educational mission of university."" Duderstadt is part of a growing controversy. Recently, as reported in The New York Times, an alliance between university professors and college boards of trustees formed in reaction to the growth of college sports; it's the first organization with enough clout to challenge the culture of big-time university athletics. This book is certainly part of that challenge, and is sure to influence this debate today and in the years to come. James J.

Red Star Under the Baltic: A Soviet Submariner's Personal Account 1941-1945,"Red Star Under The Baltic is the graphic memoir of a Soviet submariner during his years at sea in the Baltic during the Second World War. Not only is this a superb record of the appalling conditions endured on these basic craft, but a very human account detailing the comradeship and tensions among the crew as they operated in the most life-threatening conditions. Written in the first person, the author vividly describes the many actions that he and his comrades were involved in. Many of these were successful and Korzh witnessed numerous engagements and sinkings of German shipping. However, it was by no means a one-sided contest and there were some horrifyingly close calls. The comparatively shallow waters of the Baltic were less than ideal for submarine warfare. Perhaps the most dangerous and dramatic moment came when his submarine became entangled in netting. After frantic efforts, they just managed to extricate themselves before being depth-charged. Another constant threat was of mechanical malfunction. This book will have strong appeal to all those with an interest in the naval history of the Second World War. It is extremely rare to have a totally authentic Russian account, which has been superbly translated into English. There are strong echoes in this thrilling memoir of the classic German U-boat story Das Boot with its non-stop action and constant underwater danger. The author was born in 1912 in the small Russian village of Melguny, Viktor Korzh graduated from the Naval Training College in 1938 as a submariner engineer. His wartime experiences are the subject of this book which was first published as Reserve of Strength in 1966. After the War he remained involved with the Submarine Service as a researcher and instructor, retiring in 1960 as a Captain First Rank.

Treatise of Man (Great Minds Series),"Besides his more famous works of philosophy - Discourse on Method, Meditations on First Philosophy, and Principles of Philosophy - Descartes devoted a great deal of time and thought to the study of physiology and anatomy. An account of his activities in 1629 reports that he visited butcher shops on an almost daily basis to study specific animal organs, and he practiced dissection and even vivisection to explore the workings of major organ systems. In the 1630s, he assisted in the dissection of human cadavers - all to satisfy his intense curiosity about how bodies, animal and human, work. The fruits of this research can be found in his Treatise of Man, a work that he decided not to publish for fear of suffering the same fate as Galileo. Consequently, this fascinating treatise did not appear until twelve years after his death. Among its many intriguing features are his detailed descriptions of the nervous system and its interactions with the muscles to create movement in response to stimulus. Though we now know that many of these details are wrong, Descartes' understanding that much of the body functions as a machine was a stroke of genius. He is the first to describe the reflex arc, anticipating Pavlov and the behaviorists by almost 300 years. The idea of the body as a kind of animal machine that functions according to physical laws was an immense advance over the previous scholastic notions based on Aristotle, which merely begged the question of how the various organs of the body work by stating that it is in their nature to perform their specific functions.

Het enige wat hij nog van hem heeft, is de dictafoon die de toen zesjarige Sven voor zijn verdwijning bij zich droeg. Daarop staat zijn stem, gevolgd door een ijzige stilte.

Candide and Other Writings,"Introduction and Notes by James Fowler, Senior Lecturer in French, University of Kent. Voltaire is held to be one of the three greatest French writers of the eighteenth century. He fought against religious persecution, bigotry and injustice throughout his life, and has often been seen as one of the thinkers who prepared the way for the French Revolution. This volume contains: 'Zadig' (1748), the story of a young man who becomes king of Babylon; 'Candide' (1759), Voltaire's most famous tale of all; and (in a new translation) 'The Ingenu' (1767), in which the hero, raised by Huron Indians, discovers the ways of Europe. The heroes of these tales are young, handsome, talented, and naïve. All three are animated by Voltaire's sparkling wit, but also by his dark satire of ancien regime society. The volume closes with a new translation of 'Nanine', Voltaire's three-act comedy which was seen, first as dangerously meritocratic, then as anti-revolutionary. The hero falls in love with a servant girl: but will he overcome society's prejudice and marry her? AUTHOR: Francois-Marie Arouet (1694-1778) was better known under his nom de plume of Voltaire. A prolific writer of over 2,000 books and booklets and over 20,000 letters, he is best remembered for novels such as 'Candide'.",['Voltaire'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MPl_ngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=MPl_ngEACAAJ&dq=Candide+and+Other+Writings&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2014,http://books.google.nl/books?id=MPl_ngEACAAJ&dq=Candide+and+Other+Writings&hl=&source=gbs_api,,

The Dawnchild,"TIME AND THE GODS Once when the gods were young and only Their swarthy servant Time was without age, the gods lay sleeping by a broad river upon earth. There in a valley that from all the earth the gods had set apart for Their repose the gods dreamed marble dreams. And with domes and pinnacles the dreams arose and stood up proudly between the river and the sky, all shimmering white to the morning. In the city's midst the gleaming marble of a thousand steps climbed to the citadel where arose four pinnacles beckoning to heaven, and midmost between the pinnacles there stood the dome, vast, as the gods had dreamed it. All around, terrace by terrace, there went marble lawns well guarded by onyx lions and carved with effigies of all the gods striding amid the symbols of the worlds. With a sound like tinkling bells, far off in a land of shepherds hidden by some hill, the waters of many fountains turned again home. Then the gods awoke and there stood Sardathrion. Not to common men have the gods given to walk Sardathrion's streets, and not to common eyes to see her fountains. Only to those to whom in lonely passes in the night the gods have spoken, leaning through the stars, to those that have heard the voices of the gods above the morning or seen Their faces bending above the sea, only to those hath it been given to see Sardathrion, to stand where her pinnacles gathered together in the night fresh from the dreams of gods. For round the valley a great desert lies through which no common traveller may come, but those whom the gods have chosen feel suddenly a great longing at heart, and crossing the mountains that divide the desert from the world, set out across it driven by the gods, till hidden in the desert's midst they find the valley at last and look with eyes upon Sardathrion.",['Lord Dunsany'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vY1YCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=vY1YCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT9&dq=The+Dawnchild&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,谷月社,2016-01-08,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vY1YCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],

Unvanquished,"For years the United States has treated the United Nations as an extension of its own foreign policy, while other member states--especially smaller, less influential countries--have looked to the United Nations to represent their collective interests. This conflict escalated in the fall of 1996, when the United States unilaterally decided to deny Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali a second term. In this book Boutros-Ghali argues that U.S. policy toward the United Nations threatens the fragile fabric of the international organization. By selectively consulting the Security Council, the United States has frequently condemned the United Nations to the status of scapegoat in international affairs, notably during peacekeeping missions in Bosnia, Somalia, and Rwanda. Meanwhile, the United Nations's financial crisis persists as the United States fails to pay its bills while seeking to further increase its already considerable influence within the organization. In October 1995 President Clinton lavishly praised Boutros-Ghali for his ""outstanding leadership,"" and thanked him for his ""vision."" Yet, a mere four months later, the Clinton administration decided that Boutros-Ghali would have to go. What happened in that short time to convince the United States that the secretary-general was now a liability? United States domestic electoral politics were decisive: While campaigning for the primaries, Bob Dole was scoring heavily by repeatedly ridiculing Boutros-Ghali. To neutralize Dole's challenge, Clinton denied the controversial secretary-general a second term, vetoing his reelection in the Security Council despite unanimous support from its other members. Boutros-Ghali reveals the dramatic conflict and the personalities involved and considers the future of the United Nations in light of American domination.",['Boutros Boutros-Ghali'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fHpPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=fHpPEAAAQBAJ&dq=Unvanquished&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Random House,1999-06-01,http://books.google.nl/books?id=fHpPEAAAQBAJ&dq=Unvanquished&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],

It’s a real message of hope.’ Michael Morpurgo Discover this beloved masterpiece of nature writing that is a hymn to creation and to the power of the individual to do their bit to change the world for the better. In 1910, while hiking through the wild lavender in a wind-swept, desolate valley in Provence, a man comes across a shepherd called Elzéard Bouffier. Staying with him, he watches Elzéard sorting and then planting hundreds of acorns as he walks through the wilderness. Ten years later, after surviving the First World War, he visits the shepherd again and sees the young forest he has created spreading slowly over the valley. Elzéard’s solitary, silent work continues and the narrator returns year after year to see the miracle he is gradually creating: a verdant, green landscape that is a testament to one man’s creative instinct.

"The Kindling (The Fire-Us Trilogy, Book 1)","It is the year 2007. The world has been wiped out by a deadly plague that killed all the adults. Without them, children perished of hunger and disease. No more people, no more electricity, no more civilization -- just mildewed houses, overgrown yards, and abandoned cars. Yet on a highway strip outside a small town in Florida, the words ""We're Still Here"" are painted in letters big enough to be seen from an airplane -- although no planes ever cross the empty sky. Miraculously, seven children have survived among the ruins. They cannot remember their names, their families, or much else from the Before Time. But they have forged a new family, with new names: Mommy, Hunter, Teacher, Action Figure, Teddy Bear, Baby, and Doll. They must face each day with enough hope to endure and the strength to realize that there may be nothing out there worth living for. Then one day, a new kid shows up on their doorstep and changes everything. He invites them to join him on a dangerous journey to Washington, to find a man called President if he's still alive -- and seek the answers to the mystery at the heart of the Fire-us.

Red-Color News Soldier,"In 1966 lanceerde de ouder wordende Mao een ambitieus programma om zijn nalatenschap veilig te stellen. Hij liet de Rode Gardisten los op zijn vijanden en alles wat herinnerde aan de oude cultuur. Al snel bevochten gewapende rivaliserende partijen elkaar op straat, in naam van revolutionaire puurheid. De Culturele Revolutie was begonnen. Het leger ging zich ermee bemoeien en het land veranderde in een politiestaat met bloedige zuiveringsacties die een op de vijftig mensen het leven kostten. Maar ook het leger moest uiteindelijk het onderspit delve tijdens de Culturele Revolutie. Inwoners van steden en dorpen zagen een kans om onder de planeconomie uit te komen en de vrije markt weer tot leven te wekken. In het hele land gingen miljoenen en miljoenen dorpsbewoners terug naar de traditionele manier van leven en werken, er ontstonden zwarte markten, het land werd teruggegeven aan families en er werden illegale fabrieken geopend. Zelfs voordat Mao overleed in 1976 hadden grote delen van het platteland al afscheid genomen van de planeconomie. Nieuw bewijsmateriaal uit de archieven maakt duidelijk dat het deze burgers waren die het maoïsme met hun stille revolutie ten grave hebben gedragen. De Culturele Revolutie, een volksgeschiedenis, 1962-1976, is het derde boek in Dikötters ‘Volks’-trilogie over China in de tijd van Mao. Het eerste boek is De tragiek van de bevrijding, de geschiedenis van de Chinese Revolutie, 1945-1957, het tweede boek is Mao’s massamoord, De geschiedenis van China’s grootste drama, 1958-1962. De drie boeken geven elk een nauwkeurig en indringend beeld van een deel van het Mao-tijdperk en zijn uitstekend los van elkaar te lezen. De boeken zijn in China verboden. Frank Dikötter werd in 1961 in Nederland geboren en groeide op in Zwitserland. Sinds 2006 is hij hoogleraar Humanistiek aan de Universiteit van Hongkong, voor die tijd was hij hoogleraar Moderne Chinese geschiedenis aan de Universiteit van Londen. In 2011 won hij de Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction.",['Frank Dikötter'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0CT0CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=0CT0CwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Red-Color+News+Soldier&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Spectrum,2016-05-25,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0CT0CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],

The Spiral Dance 10th Anniversary Edition (A Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess),"The twentieth anniversary edition of The Spiral Dance celebrates the pivotal role the book has had in bringing Goddess worship to the religious forefront. This bestselling classic is both an unparalleled reference on the practices and philosophies of Witchcraft and a guide to the life-affirming ways in which readers can turn to the Goddess to deepen their sense of personal pride, develop their inner power, and integrate mind, body, and spirit. Starhawk's brilliant, comprehensive overview of the growth, suppression, and modern-day re-emergence of Wicca as a Goddess-worshipping religion has left an indelible mark on the feminist spiritual consciousness. In a new introduction, Starhawk reveals the ways in which Goddess religion and the practice of ritual have adapted and developed over the last twenty years, and she reflects on the ways in which these changes have influenced and enhanced her original ideas.

Stubborn Twig: Three Generations in the Life of a Japanese American Family,"Stubborn Twig, originally published in 1994, is a classic American tale of immigrants making their way in a new land. Masuo Yasui arrived in America in 1903 with big dreams and empty pockets.

December 7, 1941, changed the family's lives completely and forever. Forced from their homes and interned in vast inland ""camps"", the family was shamed and broken.

Field Quantization,"Theoretical physics has become a many-faceted science. For the young stu dent it is difficult enough to cope with the overwhelming amount of new scientific material that has to be learned, let alone obtain an overview of the entire field, which ranges from mechanics through electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, field theory, nuclear and heavy-ion science, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, and solid-state theory to elementary-particle physics. And this knowledge should be acquired in just 8-10 semesters, during which, in addition, a Diploma or Master's thesis has to be worked on or examinations prepared for. All this can be achieved only if the university teachers help to introduce the student to the new disciplines as early on as possible, in order to create interest and excitement that in turn set free essential new energy. At the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt we therefore con front the student with theoretical physics immediately, in the first semester. Theoretical Mechanics I and II, Electrodynamics, and Quantum Mechanics I - An Introduction are the basic courses during the first two years. These lectures are supplemented with many mathematical explanations and much support material. After the fourth semester of studies, graduate work begins, and Quantum Mechanics II - Symmetries, Statistical Mechanics and Ther modynamics, Relativistic Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Electrodynamics, the Gauge Theory of Weak Interactions, and Quantum Chromo dynamics are obligatory.","['Walter Greiner', 'Joachim Reinhardt']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=C-DVBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=C-DVBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Field+Quantization&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-06-29,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=C-DVBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Science'],1.0

Sir Ranulph Fiennes 'This wonderful book is a reminder of how much careful thought was given to the shape of the world even in ancient times - the landscape, how places are related to one another.

The Husbands: An Account of Books 3 and 4 of Homer's Iliad,"This collection of essays examines the various ways in which the Homeric epics have been responded to, reworked, and rewritten by women writers of the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Beginning in 1914 with the First World War, it charts this understudied strand of the history of Homeric reception over the subsequent century up to the present day, analysing the extraordinary responses both to the Odyssey and to the Iliad by women from around the world. The backgrounds of these authors and the genres they employ - memoir, poetry, children's literature, rap, novels - testify not only to the plasticity of Homeric epic, but also to the widening social classes to whom Homer appeals, and it is unsurprising to see the myriad ways in which women writers across the globe have played their part in the story of Homer's afterlife. From surrealism to successive waves of feminism to creative futures, Homer's footprint can be seen in a multitude of different literary and political movements, and the essays in this volume bring an array of critical approaches to bear on the work of authors ranging from H.D. and Simone Weil to Christa Wolf, Margaret Atwood, and Kate Tempest. Students and scholars of not only classics, but also translation studies, comparative literature, and women's writing will find much to interest them, while the volume's concluding reflections by Emily Wilson on her new translation of the Odyssey are an apt reminder to all of just how open a text can be, and of how great a difference can be made by a woman's voice.","['Fiona Cox', 'Elena Theodorakopoulos']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UR6yDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=UR6yDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA316&dq=The+Husbands:+An+Account+of+Books+3+and+4+of+Homer%27s+Iliad&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,"Oxford University Press, USA",2019-10,http://books.google.nl/books?id=UR6yDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Husbands:+An+Account+of+Books+3+and+4+of+Homer%27s+Iliad&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Literary Criticism'],

How to Play Black Gospel: For Beginners,"We are made in the image and likeness of God. Bernard of Clairvaux, the versatile troubadour of Christian love, is no naive romantic. He understands that a series of moral changes must precede any exercise of this love. For him, the seat of love is the faculty of the human will (the Image). On the other hand, the uninhibited action of free choice (the Likeness) constitutes the perfection of the faculty. The Image, because of sin and consequent misery, has lost its Likeness to God. Only divine intervention, through the efficacy of grace, can restore Likeness and cleanse the blemished Image. The text is not a polemic, but rather and apologia rooted in Bernard''s personal experience. The ardour of love springs from a flourishing freedom, the direct result of a double cause: divine grace and the restored union of Image and Likeness. Without free choice there is nothing to be saved; while without grace there is no salvation.",['Robert L.

Incident at Big Sky,"Edgar Award Finalist: The “exciting” true story of the abduction of biathlete Kari Swenson and the five-month manhunt to bring her tormentors to justice (The New York Times Book Review). Former rodeo cowboy Johnny France had been sheriff of Madison County, Montana, for three years when Kari Swenson, a Bozeman resident training for the World Biathlon Championship, went missing near Big Sky Resort in July 1984. Her friends feared that Kari had been attacked by a grizzly bear, but the truth was far scarier: She’d been kidnapped at gunpoint by father-and-son survivalists Don and Dan Nichols. The pair had been living in the wilderness off and on for years and hoped to make Kari a “mountain woman” and Dan’s bride. But the plan went horribly wrong from the start, and after a deadly firefight with rescuers, the kidnappers vanished into the rugged terrain of the Spanish Peaks. As Montana’s summer froze into brutal winter blizzards, SWAT teams, forest rangers, and antiterrorist units searched the backcountry but sighted the mountain men only once. Then came the call about a strange campfire on a slope above the Madison River. Sheriff France decided to go into the forest to face the fugitives—alone. The resulting showdown made him “perhaps the most famous Western sheriff since Wyatt Earp . . . a modern legend” (Chicago Tribune). Incident at Big Sky is an “amazing . . . exciting retelling of a modern crime” that made headlines around the world (The New York Times Book Review). In a voice as distinctive and compelling as the Montana landscape, France takes readers on a high-stakes adventure so bizarre and unforgettable it could only be true.","['Johnny France', 'Malcolm McConnell']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7Oo9DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=7Oo9DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Incident+at+Big+Sky&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Open Road Media,2017-03-21,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7Oo9DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['True Crime'],
A Paratrooper's Panoramic View: Training with the 464th Parachute Field Artillery Battalion for Operation Varsity's 'Rhine Jump' with the 17th Airborne Division,"At 10:00 AM on March 24, 1945, a literal “sky train” of two and one-half hours in length flew in 226 C-47 and 72 C-46 transport planes carrying 17,122 paratroopers together with 906 gliders being pulled by 610 C-47 tow planes. Paratrooper Robert L. Wilson jumped from the lead serial of planes in this largest airborne assault in military history. He landed in the designated drop zone near Wesel. There, with others in “Branigan’s Bastard Battalion,” – the 464th Parachute Field Artillery Battalion – he made history as part of the first artillery airborne outfit to land, reassemble, and fire their howitzer’s east of the Rhine River. Field Marshall Montgomery, who had elaborately orchestrated this airborne assault, gathered Prime Minister Churchill together with Generals Eisenhower, Ridgway, and Brereton on the western bank of the Rhine to watch the air spectacle unfold. The objectives of this airborne assault – Operation Varsity – were achieved predominantly through the efforts of the U.S. 17th and British 6th Airborne Divisions. These troopers closed in along the Rhine all along its length to prevent any German stronghold from being secured on its bank. They later thrust across Germany’s northern plains en route to Berlin. In sum, Varsity’s success accelerated the Nazi collapse. A Paratrooper’s Panoramic View provides readers a historical perspective of Varsity from one of the Operation’s participants. In it, Wilson vividly recounts the attractions of the airborne during the early days of Army parachute training. From entering Ft. Benning’s Parachute School in 1943, to Camp Mackall, to Europe’s “Cigarette Camps,” to the Marshalling Area in Chalons-sur-Marne, France, in March 1945, this book closely follows the preparations that guided this trooper towards the “Rhine Jump.”","['Robert L.

Manga! Manga!: World of Japanese Comic Books,"Manga in Japanese means ""comics,"" and comics in Japan are simply the most marvelous multifaceted misunderstood mass-market monster publishing phenomenon ever, anywhere. A multibillion dollar industry ... tens of millions of devoted fans ... thousands of ceaselessly toiling artists, a few of whom grow fabulously wealthy. There's something for everyone, too, from historical romances set in the French revolution and bloody duels between medieval samurai, to tales of wrestlers, enlightened Buddhist sages, spacemen, anthropomorphic cats, gangsters, girls in and out of love, warrior robots, sushi-makers, and even the tireless Mr. Nobody at the office, the esteemed soldier in Japan's economic-miracle army. Until now, this world has been hardly remarked upon by Western observers, except for mention of the fact that on trains, in restaurants, and indeed at every leisure moment the Japanese seem to have their heads buried in comics. But with this book Japanese comics emerge in all their spectacular variety for the first time in English. Author Fred Schodt offers a wealth of highlights and sidelights into history, themes, and artists. And every page is chock-full of samples from Japanese comic magazines. Here is popular culture running at a high pitch, and outsiders might find it all a bit puzzling and perverse. So if you're a bit straitlaced take it slow. But if your assumptions about comics are open to challenge, or if you thought you knew the real Japan because you've read all about Zen and the tea ceremony and Theory Z, read on, read on.",['Frederik L.

Marcel, the jovial, wise owner of the Parisian bookshop that is the center of much of the story is just the right catalyst. This book was a pleasure to read, an excellent rendering of the hero and the heroine's quests for finality and redemption.""

The Gardener,"One of the world's leading child psychologists shatters the myth of ""good parenting"" Caring deeply about our children is part of what makes us human. Yet the thing we call ""parenting"" is a surprisingly new invention. In the past thirty years, the concept of parenting and the multibillion dollar industry surrounding it have transformed child care into obsessive, controlling, and goal-oriented labor intended to create a particular kind of child and therefore a particular kind of adult. In The Gardener and the Carpenter, the pioneering developmental psychologist and philosopher Alison Gopnik argues that the familiar twenty-first-century picture of parents and children is profoundly wrong--it's not just based on bad science, it's bad for kids and parents, too. Drawing on the study of human evolution and her own cutting-edge scientific research into how children learn, Gopnik shows that although caring for children is profoundly important, it is not a matter of shaping them to turn out a particular way. Children are designed to be messy and unpredictable, playful and imaginative, and to be very different both from their parents and from each other. The variability and flexibility of childhood lets them innovate, create, and survive in an unpredictable world. “Parenting"" won't make children learn—but caring parents let children learn by creating a secure, loving environment.",['Alison Gopnik'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5a9nCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=5a9nCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Gardener&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,"Farrar, Straus and Giroux",2016-08-09,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5a9nCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Family & Relationships'],

"One Nation: America Remembers September 11, 2001","In this expanded tenth-anniversary edition of the No. 1 New York Times bestselling book, LIFE returns to the story that it chronicled with such immediacy following the devastating, heartbreaking, and inspiring events in New York, Washington, D.C. and Pennsylvania. These pages bear witness to the horrific losses of 9/11 but also celebrate the inspirational bravery of those who persevered, risking their lives in unpredictable and terrifying circumstances. This became the document of the day, the book Americans needed at the time-and can gain some measure of understanding from once more. ONE NATION was and is, as the Wall Street Journal said ten years ago, ""a thoughtful and thorough telling."" This expanded edition includes a new foreword by Tom Brokaw, reflections on how the nation has changed in the decade since 9/11, updates on the people involved that day, and new and exclusive portraits by award-winning photographer Joe McNally, who made indelible pictures at Ground Zero in the immediate aftermath of the tragic event. For decades, Americans have turned to LIFE to see, understand, and remember the most important events of history. In addition to a powerful array of photographs taken by many of the world's greatest photographers, ONE NATION includes original essays by some of our finest writers. Contributors include David McCullough, Maya Angelou, James Bradley, Melissa Fay Greene, Margaret Carlson, Bob Greene and many others. To re-read these pieces today is to revisit an astonishing moment.

Blue-Eyed Child of Fortune: The Civil War Letters of Col. Robert Gould Shaw,"On the Boston Common stands one of the great Civil War memorials, a magnificent bronze sculpture by Augustus Saint-Gaudens. It depicts the black soldiers of the Fifty-fourth Massachusetts Infantry marching alongside their young white commander, Colonel Robert Gould Shaw. When the philosopher William James dedicated the memorial in May 1897, he stirred the assembled crowd with these words: ""There they march, warm-blooded champions of a better day for man. There on horseback among them, in the very habit as he lived, sits the blue-eyed child of fortune."" In this book Shaw speaks for himself with equal eloquence through nearly two hundred letters he wrote to his family and friends during the Civil War. The portrait that emerges is of a man more divided and complex--though no less heroic--than the Shaw depicted in the celebrated film Glory. The pampered son of wealthy Boston abolitionists, Shaw was no abolitionist himself, but he was among the first patriots to respond to Lincoln's call for troops after the attack on Fort Sumter. After Cedar Mountain and Antietam, Shaw knew the carnage of war firsthand. Describing nightfall on the Antietam battlefield, he wrote, ""the crickets chirped, and the frogs croaked, just as if nothing unusual had happened all day long, and presently the stars came out bright, and we lay down among the dead, and slept soundly until daylight. There were twenty dead bodies within a rod of me."" When Federal war aims shifted from an emphasis on restoring the Union to the higher goal of emancipation for four million slaves, Shaw's mother pressured her son into accepting the command of the North's vanguard black regiment, the Fifty-fourth Massachusetts. A paternalist who never fully reconciled his own prejudices about black inferiority, Shaw assumed the command with great reluctance. Yet, as he trained his recruits in Readville, Massachusetts, during the early months of 1963, he came to respect their pluck and dedication. ""There is not the least doubt,"" he wrote his mother, ""that we shall leave the state, with as good a regiment, as any that has marched."" Despite such expressions of confidence, Shaw in fact continued to worry about how well his troops would perform under fire. The ultimate test came in South Carolina in July 1863, when the Fifty-fourth led a brave but ill-fated charge on Fort Wagner, at the approach to Charleston Harbor. As Shaw waved his sword and urged his men forward, an enemy bullet felled him on the fort's parapet. A few hours later the Confederates dumped his body into a mass grave with the bodies of twenty of his men. Although the assault was a failure from a military standpoint, it proved the proposition to which Shaw had reluctantly dedicated himself when he took command of the Fifty-fourth: that black soldiers could indeed be fighting men. By year's end, sixty new black regiments were being organized. A previous selection of Shaw's correspondence was privately published by his family in 1864. For this volume, Russell Duncan has restored many passages omitted from the earlier edition and has provided detailed explanatory notes to the letters. In addition he has written a lengthy biographical essay that places the young colonel and his regiment in historical context.",['Robert Gould Shaw'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6m5h0Ax6tr4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=6m5h0Ax6tr4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Blue-Eyed+Child+of+Fortune:+The+Civil+War+Letters+of+Col.+Robert+Gould+Shaw&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,University of Georgia Press,2011-08-15,http://books.google.nl/books?id=6m5h0Ax6tr4C&dq=Blue-Eyed+Child+of+Fortune:+The+Civil+War+Letters+of+Col.+Robert+Gould+Shaw&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],

"The Fabulous Sylvester: The Legend, the Music, the Seventies in San Francisco","A journey back through the music, madness, and unparalleled freedom of an era of change-the '70s-as told through the life of ultra-fabulous superstar Sylvester Imagine a pied piper singing in a dazzling falsetto, wearing glittering sequins, and leading the young people of the nation to San Francisco and on to liberation where nothing was straight-laced or old-fashioned. And everyone, finally, was welcome-to come as themselves. This is not a fairy tale. This was real, mighty real, and disco sensation Sylvester was the piper. Joshua Gamson-a Yale-trained pop culture expert-uses him, a boy who would be fabulous, to lead us through the story of the '70s when a new era of change liberated us from conformity and boredom. Gamson captures the exuberant life, feeling, energy, and fun of a generation's wonderful, magical waking up-from the parties to the dancing and music. The story begins with a little black boy who started with nothing but a really big voice. We follow him from the Gospel chorus to the glory days in the Castro where a generation shook off its shame as Sylvester sang and began his rise as part of a now-notorious theatrical troup called the Cockettes. Celebrity, sociology, and music history mingle and merge around this endlessly entertaining story of a singer who embodied the freedom, spirit, and flamboyance of a golden moment in American culture.",['Joshua Gamson'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3Y0TAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3Y0TAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Fabulous+Sylvester:+The+Legend,+the+Music,+the+Seventies+in+San+Francisco&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Henry Holt and Company,2013-07-30,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3Y0TAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Music'],3.0

More than an engaging guide to the subtle intricacies of the sport, Walton's reflective treatise is a graceful portrait of rural England that extols the pleasures of country life. 'The Compleat Angler is not about how to fish but about how to be,' said novelist Thomas McGuane. '[Walton] spoke of an amiable mortality and rightness on the earth that has been envied by his readers for three hundred years.'","['Izaak Walton', 'Charles Cotton']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uxd2lxuJdV0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uxd2lxuJdV0C&q=The+compleat+angler:+Or,+The+contemplative+man%27s+recreation+(Little+library)&dq=The+compleat+angler:+Or,+The+contemplative+man%27s+recreation+(Little+library)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Modern Library,1996,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uxd2lxuJdV0C&dq=The+compleat+angler:+Or,+The+contemplative+man%27s+recreation+(Little+library)&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Sports & Recreation'],

""Almayer’s Folly"" (1895) is Joseph Conrad’s debut novel. It centers on the Dutch trader Kaspar Almayer, who comes to Borneo with a suitcaseful of dreams. He settles on the exotic island among the Malays and mainly deals in river trade. His half-Malay daughter, Nina, is met with reluctance by the local community. But Almayer wants to put an end to his waning career as a merchant and hopes to find the island's hidden gold mine, so that he can return to Amsterdam as a wealthy man, with his daughter, and give her both financial and social status. But fate can be cruel, not least in the colonies. ALMAYER’S FOLLY A STORY OF AN EASTERN RIVER This is the story of a man living at the edge of two cultures, having to adapt both sociologically and psychologically to a new environment. Here Conrad masterfully combines romance and adventure with moral and existential issues. Joseph Conrad (1857-1924) was a Polish-born author who left Poland in his teens to avoid enlistment in the Russian Army. He learned English aboard British ships and started writing in that language after settling in England. His most famous novel is ""Heart of Darkness"" (1899), which was inspired by his experiences on the open sea.

Construction Safety Planning (Industrial Health & Safety),"Construction Safety Planning David V. MacCollum Construction Safety Planning is a comprehensive, practical, step-by-step guide for those who design and oversee large and small projects. Designed to facilitate compliance with new OSHA objectives, it presents, for those who are responsible for construction safety, what questions to ask in order to avoid conditions that invite injury or death on site. The book shows how to integrate safety planning into existing design and construction scheduling in order to avoid duplicating paperwork that is normally associated with safety planning. Advice is given on how to involve all supervisory personnel as hazard hunters, so that timely prevention measures can be taken. Author David V. MacCollum is a forty-five-year veteran safety engineer who participated in the development of safety planning concepts used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on big dam projects in the Pacific Northwest during the 1950s. In this clearly written reference he highlights the concepts and practices that reduced construction deaths by 75 percent and are today still enabling the Corps of Engineers to enjoy the same reduction nationwide, when compared to similar work not under its supervision--the end result being savings of several billion dollars each year. The risk of death on the job for construction workers is five times greater than that of the average American worker. A new OSHA era will change that. With this book, everyone working in the field of construction--from design to maintenance--will have the tools and knowledge to make a difference.",['David V.

"For You, My Sons","This book is a Christian book where most of the parts of the human body have been mentioned with a little description of what their normal functions in the human body are, and spiritual functions. God gave us his Son because he loved us. That is why he gave us so many gifts through the Holy Spirit. 1 Peter 4:10 tells us that every one of us has been given a gift. We should use these gifts for the benefit of the body of Christ. God thought of the world and gave us his son. To function the way God wanted us to, he gave us tools to use. He did not want to impose these tools on us. It is up to each individual to take up these tools and use them. God made them available to us. The book starts off at looking at 1 Corinthians 12. Then all the chapters that follow relate the various parts of the body to how they would function as parts in the body of Christ. The brain and the nervous system as the head. The Skin as the Protection. The muscles and the skeleton as the cover and shape. The ears as the hearing aid and balancing scale. The nose as the sense of smell. The tongue as the fire.. The throat as the antibiotic.The mouth as the gate. The eyes as the miraculous sight. of the body The heart and circulation as the pump or engine. The respiratory system as the air provider. The reproductive system as the maternity. The urinary system as the filtering and drainage system. The endocrine system as the messenger or trouble-shooter.

Work and Play in Early Childhood,"This book brings together an international group of researchers reporting on their work about play and early childhood education across 13 countries – Norway, Sweden, Denmark, England, Germany, Hong Kong, United States of America, India, The Maldives, Sri Lanka, Singapore, China and Australia. It contributes to growing international conversations about play and the role of play in early childhood education. Each of the chapters in this anthology reflects different directions in research as well as a range of approaches to reconceptualising play. Each researcher questions assumptions underpinning young children’s play and early childhood education and explores the implications of these questions for further research, practice and policy. Chapters report a wide range of innovative and transformative research, focusing on areas such as the play of infants and toddlers, the role of values in play, the complexity of connections between play and learning, motivation, the role and understandings of early childhood educators in promoting children’s play, risky play and the impact of Westernised approaches to play in different contexts. This book argues for the importance of children’s play at a time when there is a great deal of pressure to increase the academic focus of early education and to eliminate play that could be deemed risky. Several authors note moves towards pedagogies of play and explore the potential links between play and learning in early education settings. The research reported in this book is a timely reminder of the value of play, for and of itself, as well as the learning potential of play. It provides a pathway into the debates about the role and value of play in early years education for students, researchers and policy-makers.","['Ole Fredrik Lillemyr', 'Sue Dockett', 'Bob Perry']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HZ63AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=HZ63AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Work+and+Play+in+Early+Childhood&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,IAP,2013-09-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HZ63AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Social Science'],

"Totline 123 Math: Pre-Math Activities for Working With Young Children (1-2-3 Series, Math: Ages 3-6)","Op een koude novemberdag worden de doorgewinterde rechercheur Maud Mertens en de jonge Kyra Slagter weer samengebracht door een mysterieuze zaak. Twee jonge kinderen verdwijnen op bijna hetzelfde moment. Hoewel de politie met man en macht onderzoek doet, kan dat niet voorkomen dat er de volgende dagen meer kinderen ontvoerd worden. Er is geen enkele connectie tussen de verdwijningen: ze vinden overal in West-Nederland plaats, de kinderen zijn tussen de acht en twaalf jaar oud en er wordt geen losgeld geëist. Diverse Amber Alerts leveren niets op. Hoe meer kinderen verdwijnen, hoe groter de onrust in het land wordt. Voor Mertens vormen de verdwijningen een onwelkome herinnering aan een oude zaak waarin een jong meisje slachtoffer werd. Toch maakt dit juist dat ze verbeten achter de ontvoerders aan gaat. Kyra weet wat het is als een familielid wordt weggerukt en je vol vragen achterblijft: ontvoerd, vermist, vermoord? De zaak spoort haar nog meer aan haar eigen vermiste zus te vinden: vier jaar geleden verdween Sarina, zonder spoor of bericht. Tot Kyra ineens een briefkaart van Sarina ontvangt.

What's a Body to Do: The Breast Cancer Case Manager,"What's a Body To Do? The Breast Cancer Case Manager is part personal narrative, part resource guide, part personal organizer and workbook. It's designed to help newly diagnosed women start coping with their own cancer treatment. Written by a writer who was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma shortly after her 49th birthday, the Case Manager contains all the useful advice and information she received from the people she met on her own journey through Cancerland: doctors, nurses, cancer counselors, social workers, support group members. The Case Manager is organized chronologically, covering diagnosis, surgery, treatment, dealing with health plans, managing mental health, what it means to be a ""survivor"" and more. The key chapters break down into two parts: first the humorous/ironic tale of the author's own experience with highlighted ""tips"" along the way, and second the ""personal organizer."" The organizer contains: annotated resource sections containing a selection of books, groups and Internet sites that provide reliable information without being overwhelming suggested questions to ask doctors diary pages master appointment record address book place to record pathology and test reports chemo and radiation ""symptom journals"" The organizer provides the patient a way to keep all her ""information"" in one place, in a format compact enough to take along whenever she goes to the doctor's office. The narrative is filled with humor--if not exactly laugh-out-loud-so-hard-till-you-cry funny, at least smile-in-understanding, wince-with-the-irony funny. Why? Because studies show that a good laugh is therapeutic, not to mention a very practical defense mechanism that can help anyone get through the terrible and terrifying experience of breast cancer treatment. Despite the hundreds of books about breast cancer on the market, no other book is a case manager. No other single book provides the breast cancer patient a pre-packaged personal organizer to manage her own treatment -- so important when a woman is faced with the myriad, new and often bewildering details of being a cancer patient. The goal of What's a Body To Do? The Breast Cancer Case Manager is to make it easier for women to take back control of their lives and manage their own, unique treatment. Knowledge is power, and the Case Manager provides women the launching pad from which to acquire it.

The New England Table,"This book considers three defining movements driven from London and within the region that describe the experience of the Church of England in New England between 1686 and 1786. It explores the radical imperial political and religious change that occurred in Puritan New England following the late seventeenth-century introduction of a new charter for the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the Anglican Church in Boston and the public declaration of several Yale ‘apostates’ at the 1722 college commencement exercises. These events transformed the religious circumstances of New England and fuelled new attention and interest in London for the national church in early America. The political leadership, controversial ideas and forces in London and Boston during the run-up to and in the course of the War for Independence, was witnessed by and affected the Church of England in New England. The book appeals to students and researchers of English History, British Imperial History, Early American History and Religious History.",['James B.

"Moctezuma's Children: Aztec Royalty under Spanish Rule, 1520-1700","Though the Aztec Empire fell to Spain in 1521, three principal heirs of the last emperor, Moctezuma II, survived the conquest and were later acknowledged by the Spanish victors as reyes naturales (natural kings or monarchs) who possessed certain inalienable rights as Indian royalty. For their part, the descendants of Moctezuma II used Spanish law and customs to maintain and enhance their status throughout the colonial period, achieving titles of knighthood and nobility in Mexico and Spain. So respected were they that a Moctezuma descendant by marriage became Viceroy of New Spain (colonial Mexico's highest governmental office) in 1696. This authoritative history follows the fortunes of the principal heirs of Moctezuma II across nearly two centuries. Drawing on extensive research in both Mexican and Spanish archives, Donald E. Chipman shows how daughters Isabel and Mariana and son Pedro and their offspring used lawsuits, strategic marriages, and political maneuvers and alliances to gain pensions, rights of entailment, admission to military orders, and titles of nobility from the Spanish government. Chipman also discusses how the Moctezuma family history illuminates several larger issues in colonial Latin American history, including women's status and opportunities and trans-Atlantic relations between Spain and its New World colonies.",['Donald E.

Wren,"'This fascinating biography . . . A perfect Christmas present for any birder' Birdwatching From the BESTSELLING AUTHOR of The Robin: A Biography, STEPHEN MOSS: The wren is a paradox of a bird. They are Britain's most common bird, with 8.5 million breeding pairs and have by far the loudest song in proportion to their size. They also thrive up and down Britain and Ireland: from the smallest city garden to remote offshore islands, blustery moors to chilly mountains.Yet many people are not sure if they have ever seen a wren. Perhaps because the wren is so tiny, weighing just as much as two A4 sheets of paper, and so busy, always on the move, more mouse than bird. However if we cast our eyes back to recent history wrens were a mainstay of literary, cultural and popular history. The wren was on postage stamps and the farthing, it featured in nursery rhymes and greetings cards, poems and rural 'wren hunts', still a recent memory in Ireland particularly. With beautiful illustrations throughout, this captivating year-in-the-life biography reveals the hidden secrets of this fascinating bird that lives right on our doorstep.",['Stephen Moss'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xTBLDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=xTBLDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Wren&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Random House,2018-10-25,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xTBLDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Nature'],

Seahenge: A Quest for Life and Death in Bronze Age Britain,"One of the most haunting and enigmatic archaeological discoveries of recent times was the uncovering in 1998 at low tide of the so-called Seahenge on the north coast of Norfolk.

It focused national attention on archaeology to an extent not seen for many years, and the issues raised by its removal and preservation made it a ""cause celebre"". Francis Pryor has been at the centre of British archaeological fieldwork for nearly 30 years, piecing together the way of life of Bronze Age people, their settlement of the landscape, their religion and rituals.

The Practice of Prayer: A Companion Guide,"Christianity is about knowing God, and central to that knowing is the practice of prayer. So it is important for Christians, even those comfortable with prayer, to be stretched to pray beyond the confines of their present patterns. The Practice of Prayer is not merely another book on prayer to read, it is a hands-on experience with prayer. With spiritual exercises at the end of each chapter, this warmly written prayer manual is a companion in the quest for a richer devotional life and a coach for improving every aspect of prayer. With our prayer-resistant pace of life, we tend to restrict prayer to words said, but the process is much deeper.

Of Mice and Men (Penguin Audiobooks),"Penguin Classics presents John Steinbeck’s classic tale as an eBook enhanced with ten exclusive video clips featuring students responses, questions for classroom discussions, and an American Dream assignment Nobel Prize-winner John Steinbeck’s Of Mice and Men remains one of America's most widely read and taught novels. An unlikely pair, George and Lennie, two migrant workers in California during the Great Depression, grasp for their American Dream. Laborers in California's dusty vegetable fields, they hustle work when they can, living a hand-to-mouth existence. For George and Lennie have a plan: to own an acre of land and a shack they can call their own. When they land jobs on a ranch in the Salinas Valley, the fulfillment of their dream seems to be within their grasp. But even George cannot guard Lennie from the provocations, nor predict the consequences of Lennie's unswerving obedience to the things George taught him. Of Mice and Men: Teacher’s Edition includes the following: • An introduction and suggested further reading by Susan Shillinglaw, a professor of English at San Jose State University and Scholar-in-Residence at the National Steinbeck Center in Salinas • The poem “To a Mouse, On Turning Her Up in Her Nest with the Plough, November 1785” by Robert Burns (the original source of Steinbeck’s title Of Mice and Men) • The 1962 Nobel Banquet Speech by John Steinbeck • An exclusive audio interview with award-winning actor James Earl Jones on his stage performances in Of Mice and Men • Ten exclusive videos of students on major themes from the novel tied to group discussion questions included in the eBook, and an American Dream assignment, for the ultimate educational experience",['John Steinbeck'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gpwqbgA0m5EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=gpwqbgA0m5EC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Of+Mice+and+Men+(Penguin+Audiobooks)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2013-01-03,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gpwqbgA0m5EC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],

Tipping the Scales of Justice: Fighting Weight Based Discrimination,"What rights, if any, do fat people have? If a child is obese, are the parents legally responsible? Can employers treat overweight employees as different, or disabled? Should fat people be protected by disability laws? Cases of illegal hiring practices, workplace prejudice, harassment, unfair treatment, medical malpractice, and denial of public access are being filed in increasing numbers as the nation continues to obsess over, and misunderstand, weight.Two events in 1998-the controversial felony prosecution of a mother whose child died of obesity-related complications, and the National Institutes of Health declaration of a national weight standard-forced the weight debate to a new level of public awareness.Very little literature on the law and weight exists, so each new case is a potential precedent-setter. Tipping the Scales of Justice presents actual cases and the stories behind the legal arguments, showing for the first time the varied and surprising ways that fat has become a courtroom topic.An attorney who focuses on weight-related cases, Sondra Solovay details court attitudes toward weight in relation to employment and discrimination law, child/family law, disability law, civil rights, minorities, public policy, diets and exercise, and much more, while intermingling a personal narrative on major cases and their outcomes. This fascinating book will be essential for law courses and libraries, as well as a one-of-a-kind perspective for anyone concerned about weight as a legal issue.Sondra Solovay (Berkeley, CA), a graduate of the University of California Berkeley Boalt Hall School of Law, is an attorney and noted activist.

Despite budding friendships with other classmates--and a raging crush on a gorgeous boy named Dom--Cleo's turbulent past with Layla comes back to haunt them both. Alternating between time lines of Then and Now, When You Were Everything blends past and present into an emotional story about the beauty of self-forgiveness, the promise of new beginnings, and the courage it takes to remain open to love.

Principles of Macroeconomics,"Principles of Macroeconomics 8th edition boils economics down to its essentials, by considering what is truly important for students to learn in their first course in economics. In keeping with the authors’ philosophy of showing students the power of economic tools and the importance of economic ideas, this edition pays careful attention to regional and global policies and economic issues – including the impacts of the contemporary macroeconomic issues, inflation, unemployment, interest rates, and monetary and fiscal policy. The resource emphasises the material that students should and do find interesting about the study of the economy, resulting in a focus on applications and policy, and less on formal economic theory. Principles of Macroeconomics, 8th edition encourages students to make their own judgements by presenting both sides of the debate on five controversial issues facing policy makers: the proper degree of policy activism in response to the business cycle, the choice between rules and discretion in the conduct of monetary policy, the desirability of reaching zero inflation, the importance of balancing the government’s budget, and the need for tax reform to encourage saving.

Eyeshot (Wesleyan Poetry Series),"Scintillating new work from a celebrated contemporary poet. Runner-up for the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry (2004) Runner-up for the ForeWord magazine's Book of the Year Award (2003) Heather McHugh's new book, Eyeshot, is a brooding, visionary work that takes aim at the big questions—those of love and death. The poems suggest that such immensities balance on the smallest details, and that a range of human blindness is inescapable. The power of this new work comes from its delicate yet tenacious fidelity to the ever-unfolding senses of sense. The poems invite the reader to follow careening words and insights through passages both playful and profound. Her ""Fido, Jolted by Jove"" reveals the tension endemic to both language and living: ""the world itself is worried."" Yet the same poem remarks the high price of any reductive fix: ""a brain this insecure may need another bolt be driven in it."" This movement between anxiety and the human compulsion for order informs Eyeshot's darkly comic, 20/20 acuity.",['Heather McHugh'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=v3D2F6eAV-4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=v3D2F6eAV-4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Eyeshot+(Wesleyan+Poetry+Series)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Wesleyan University Press,2004-12-29,http://books.google.nl/books?id=v3D2F6eAV-4C&dq=Eyeshot+(Wesleyan+Poetry+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Poetry'],1.0
BOYS: CLARRISA EXPLAINS IT ALL (CLARISSA ) (Nickelodeon),"Melissa Joan Hart explained it all-from dating to bullies-in her groundbreaking role as Clarissa Darling on Clarissa Explains It All. She cast a spell on millions more viewers as Sabrina, the Teenage Witch. Now, in Melissa Explains It All, Melissa tells the frank and funny behind-the-scenes stories from her extraordinary past and her refreshingly normal present. Melissa has been entertaining audiences most of her life; when there were no girls named Melissa on her favorite show, the forceful four year old decided she'd get on television her way. From that moment on, Melissa has shown a singular determination and focus-whether it's for booking three national commercials so her dad would build her a tree house or for nailing the audition for Clarissa. From her first commercial to her current starring role in ABC Family's hit Melissa and Joey, Hart never let fame go to her head. She always had one foot in Hollywood and one foot in reality-and still does. Melissa makes us laugh along with her as she talks about: --guest appearances in shows like Saturday Night Live and The Equalizer --auditioning for Punky Brewster and Clarissa --her early Broadway days --wacky parties she's thrown and attended -- the actors who influenced her and whom she befriended, worked with and competed against --her experiences both on and off-set-with Sabrina's Salem the Cat and Elvis the Alligator on Clarissa --how she met the love of her life at the Kentucky Derby Melissa Joan Hart explains all that she's learned along the way-what's kept her grounded, normal and working when others have not been so fortunate-and that she's the approachable, hilarious girl-next-door her fans have always thought she'd be.",['Melissa Joan Hart'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=f4h4TBLiRSEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=f4h4TBLiRSEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=BOYS:+CLARRISA+EXPLAINS+IT+ALL+(CLARISSA+)+(Nickelodeon)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,St. Martin's Press,2013-10-29,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=f4h4TBLiRSEC&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],3.0

How to Stop a Stalker,"At last, a book about a tough topic that will make a difference . . . . the author . . . is more experienced than anyone I know. . . . I recommend without reservation.-Dr. W. Garrett Capune, Department of Criminal Justice, California State FullertonDet. Proctor has written, hands down, the best practical guide on how to stop a stalker . . . .-Jane Shade, Assistant Department Counsel for Orange County, CaliforniaOne out of every 12 women and one out of every 45 men in the United States are stalked in their lifetimes! If you are a victim of a stalker or suspect that you might be, this book will give you the means, not only to protect yourself, but ultimately to put the stalker behind bars. Veteran detective Mike Proctor, who has investigated and consulted on over 100 stalking cases (all of which have been successfully prosecuted), has written this essential survival guide for anyone who becomes the target of one of these sociopaths. He teaches you:- how to identify a stalker- how and why they do it- what to do if you are being stalked- how to collect evidence- how to get the justice system on your sideA pioneer who helped get stalking laws on the books, Proctor is largely responsible for alerting the law enforcement community and the public to the seriousness of the crimes of these predators. In all cases victims are subjected to mental abuse in the form of terrorist threats directed against them. But in some cases threats lead to physical abuse and even death.Proctor lays out the typical patterns of stalker behavior: leaving bizarre gifts and notes; vandalism; surveillance; persistent contact through various means of harassment (phones, pagers, letters); breaking and entering, either to steal some personal item or just to let the victim know that his or her privacy has been violated; and a host of other nuisance tactics, including harassment of family members and family pets, filing legal actions, disrupting utility services, threats of violence, and the latest trend: cyberstalking.With his wealth of experience, Proctor offers keen insights into the pathological mindset of the stalker. For example, stalking problems often arise in a situation of domestic violence. Other stalkers are fantasy driven, often believing that the victim is in love with them. Stalkers rarely take responsibility for their actions, blaming others for making them do what they do; most have stalked more than one person. Some are disgruntled employees seeking revenge against business associates or employers, an increasingly common motive in stalking.Complete with many examples taken from actual cases, this excellent handbook on a serious social problem will be of great use to current or potential stalking victims, law enforcement officials, personnel departments, and employers.Detective Mike Proctor (Westminster, CA), a thirty-year veteran of the Westminster Police Department, is a recognized expert on stalking who has worked and consulted on over 100 stalking cases. He has appeared on 20/20, America's Most Wanted, CNN, The Maury Povich Show, Unsolved Mysteries, and Case Closed, and is frequently quoted in the press. He also consulted on the 1996 Police Officers Standards and Training video training course on stalking and teaches at both the professional and university level.",['Mike Proctor'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nz5zkpG0NPwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=nz5zkpG0NPwC&dq=How+to+Stop+a+Stalker&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Prometheus Books,,http://books.google.nl/books?id=nz5zkpG0NPwC&dq=How+to+Stop+a+Stalker&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Social Science'],

For almost forty years, BJC held a distinguished position as one of the best of the nation's junior colleges. A second, almost revolutionary, transformation occurred in 1971. Bradford became coeducational and earned the right to grant the baccalaureate degree with a four-year course of study. Since 1971, the college has maintained a reputation for innovative teaching with a rigorous liberal arts curriculum within a small, caring community of scholars and learners. In the millennial year 2000, Bradford completed 197 years of service to academia.

The Ten Grandmothers (Civilization of American Indian),"?Once in a blue moon (which means a fairly long cycle in my case) one who deals professionally with new books comes upon something that seems to him truly noteworthy and memorable-a reading experience which he will cherish for the rest of his life. And when this book is original and, indeed, unique-when it achieves something that has never been done before-one's impulse is to rent a billboard, to hire a hall, in some way to underline and emphasize the excitement and enthusiasm of his discovery, so that other readers may share his pleasure. ""This has been my experience with The Ten Grandmothers, by Alice Marriott. It was the custom of certain tribes of Indians of the Great Plains to keep a 'winter count,' or calendar, of important events. Each year an officially designated scribe or historian of the tribe inscribed on a specially selected and prepared buffalo hide (which was a sacred tribal possession) a colored pictograph commemorating the most noteworthy event of the year-the happening or circumstance for which the year would be remembered in the oral literature and traditions of the tribe. ""Miss Marriott's book is based upon such a tribal history of the Kiowas, an important and tenacious nation of the southern Great Plains, for more than a hundred years. She has taken representative incidents from this story and built each into a unified narrative of personal experience, concrete and dramatic. The thirty-three narratives fall into four groups reflecting the major phases of Kiowa history in the last century; they are called, since Kiowa .economy was based on the buffalo, The Time When There Were Plenty of Buffalo; The Time When Buffalo Were Going; The Time When Buffalo Were Gone; and Modern Times. Since the same characters appear recurringly, the book has the effect of a loosely constructed novel. ""Miss Marriott is an ethnologist. Her book is based on eight years of work with the Kiowas?work that certainly consisted of much more than superficial interviews with aged Indians. There is evidence everywhere, not only of accurate scientific knowledge of the material to be presented, but of profound human insight and understanding. ""Miss Marriott is also a creative artist of extraordinary powers. Her book has abundant humor, drama and melodrama, beauty and sordidness, pathos and tragedy: all presented sharply, objectively, with economy, restraint, and dignity. The narrative of the long journey of Wooden Lance, to see for himself and for his tribe whether the leader of the Ghost Dance movement (that inspired the last desperate, irrational struggle of the plains Indians against the whites) had 'true power is unforgettable in its simplicity and reality. The story of the Kiowa girl Leah's return from her years at a boarding school in the East to her family on the reservation is as true and socially significant as it is poignant and dramatic. ""The great achievement of Miss Marriott's book is that it makes accessible to the reader of today the essence of a culture, a way of life and thought, now almost vanished from the earth. ""We have an uneasy feeling that some special meaning and value for Americans of today and tomorrow must lie in the older cultures of our continent which our own has so largely displaced. American writers from Longfellow on have tried with varying degrees of success to capture that meaning for us. ""Miss Marriott's book shows that our feeling was justified. No discerning reader will fail to find in the men and women who are so vivid in its pages-Sitting Bear and Eagle Plume, old Quanah and Spear Woman, and the Kiowa boys riding in their jeep to enlist for the present World War-in their vision and knowledge of life and their essential experience, abundant meaning for today.""",['Alice Lee Marriott'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LvUYUNSw8KoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=LvUYUNSw8KoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Ten+Grandmothers+(Civilization+of+American+Indian)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,University of Oklahoma Press,1945,http://books.google.nl/books?id=LvUYUNSw8KoC&dq=The+Ten+Grandmothers+(Civilization+of+American+Indian)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Social Science'],

Currently available studies of 1960s girl groups/girl singers fall into one of three categories: industry-generated accounts of the music's production and sales, sociological commentaries, or omnibus chronologies/discographies.

THE HISTORY OF THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION,"Richard Pipes's authoritative history of the ""violent and disruptive acts"" that created the first modern totalitarian regime portrays the crisis at the heart of the tsarist empire.

He provides fresh accounts of the revolution's personalities and policies, crises, and cruelties, from the murder of the royal family through civil war, famine, and state terror. Brilliantly and persuasively, Pipes shows us why the resulting system owes less to the theories of Marx than it did to the character of Lenin and Russia's long authoritarian tradition.

Restless Souls : The Making of American Spirituality,"Yoga classes and Zen meditation, New-Age retreats and nature mysticism--all are part of an ongoing religious experimentation that has surprisingly deep roots in American history.

Poles in Minnesota (People Of Minnesota),"Polish Americans have been part of Minnesota history since before the state's founding. Taking up farms along newly laid rail networks, Polish immigrants fanned across the countryside in small but important concentrations. In cities like Winona and St. Paul, Northeast Minneapolis and Duluth, as well as on the Iron Range, Polish American workers helped drive a growing industrial and agricultural economy--and established their own cultural identity within the state. Polish Americans, many of them political refugees, created and sustained a wide range of community institutions from churches and schools to cultural groups and social clubs in Minnesota. They developed a significant literary tradition, published newspapers, and were instrumental in establishing the state's early labor movement. Author John Radzilowski tells the stories of individuals like Stan Wasie, a Polish immigrant boy who grew up to become a pioneer in the trucking industry, founding Merchants Motor Freight in Northeast Minneapolis in 1927. By the 1950s the successful company had 800 vehicles and its own terminals.",['John Radzilowski'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=b2DOHhitMI0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=b2DOHhitMI0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Poles+in+Minnesota+(People+Of+Minnesota)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Minnesota Historical Society,2009-06-25,http://books.google.nl/books?id=b2DOHhitMI0C&dq=Poles+in+Minnesota+(People+Of+Minnesota)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],

"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","From the dreaming spires of Oxford, graduate student Lewis Gillies and his impulsive roommate, Simon, drive north to seek a mythical creature in a misty glen in Scotland. Once there, Simon vanishes through a hole in the cairn, and Lewis follows him to a mystical place where two worlds meet, in the time-between-times. There, where Celtic champions, magic, and treachery weave the beautiful and brutal land called Albion, Lewis finds Simon. And there, schooled as a warrior, he is thrust to the front of a titanic struggle between light and darkness--a hideous, onrushing darkness that would devour not merely a kingdom but two worlds. The ancient Celts admitted no separation between this world and the Otherworld: the two were delicately interwoven, each dependent on the other. The Paradise War crosses the thin places between this world and that, as Lewis Gillies comes face-to-face with an ancient mystery--and a cosmic catastrophe in the making.",['Steve Lawhead'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PrCfPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=PrCfPwAACAAJ&dq=The+Paradise+War+(The+Song+of+Albion+trilogy,+Book+1)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Lion Books,2002-02-01,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=PrCfPwAACAAJ&dq=The+Paradise+War+(The+Song+of+Albion+trilogy,+Book+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Fiction'],20.0

The Sanford Meisner Approach Workbook II : Emotional Freedom,"Product DescriptionShortly before his death, Sanford Meisner arranged for Larry Silverberg to create a written legacy of his teaching techniques.

Not only will actors gain insight into the whole realm of the emotions, they will see very clearly the traps most actors fall into when it comes to ""being emotional"" on stage. A healthier and more effective way of working will be taught -- a way of working which brings the actor powerful and unique creativity to every part. About the AuthorLarry Silverberg is founder and Artistic Director of the Belltown Theatre Center in Seattle, WA.

William: The People's Prince,"PRINCE Harry is the most interesting - indeed the most exciting - member of the Royal Family and this no-holds-barred biography tells his story for the first time. Son of the late Princess Diana - the most famous woman on Earth - and Prince Charles, the next king, and brother of William, the king after that, he is determined to live by his mantra: 'I am what I am'. From a childhood overshadowed by his parents' troubled marriage and scarred by the tragic death of his mother, to his brilliant public performances at the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations, the London Olympics and his brother's wedding, this book charts the remarkable journey of a young man with an extraordinary destiny. Following in Diana's footsteps, his charitable works have taken him to far-flung corners of the world including Africa and the South Pole. It also reveals details of his extraordinary love life, telling for the first time what caused his affair with Cressida Bonas to collapse. The author has enjoyed unparalleled access to a wide variety of people whose lives Harry has touched: senior aides, humble members of palace staff, aristocrats, bodyguards, school friends, comrades-in-arms . . . and old flames. They piece together the tale of a young man who admirably has created a life so different from the one set out for him by what he describes as 'an accident of birth'.",['CHRIS.

A Coming of Age.,"Wat is de ware betekenis van vrijheid? Lea Ypi groeit op in Albanië, een van de meest geïsoleerde landen ter wereld, waar communistische idealen de plaats van religie innemen. Deze laatste stalinistische uithoek van Europa wordt geteisterd door schaarste en politieke executies, maar voor Lea is het haar thuis. Een plek waar mensen gelijk zijn en buren elkaar helpen – een plek van saamhorigheid en hoop. Een jaar na het neerhalen van de Berlijnse Muur komt het socialisme in Albanië in een vrije val terecht. Verkiezingen, kledingkeuze en religie worden ineens vrijgegeven, maar fabrieken sluiten, banen verdwijnen en het land gaat failliet. Terwijl de droom van haar ouders’ generatie verwordt tot de desillusie van de hare en familiegeheimen aan het licht komen, begint Lea zich af te vragen wat vrijheid nou echt betekent. Vrij is een onvergetelijk boek over volwassen worden te midden van politieke onrust. Ypi verkent op ingenieuze wijze de grenzen van vooruitgang en de last van het verleden, belicht de dunne lijn tussen idealen en werkelijkheid en onderzoekt waar onderdrukking en vrijheid elkaar raken.",['Lea Ypi'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aEFDEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=aEFDEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=A+Coming+of+Age.&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,"Bezige Bij b.v., Uitgeverij De",2021-10-28,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aEFDEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],

Noren can see that his world is not as it should be--it is wrong that only the Scholars, and their representatives the Technicians, can use metal tools and Machines. It's wrong that only those few have access to the impenetrable City, which he has always longed to enter. Above all, it is wrong for the Scholars to have sole power over the distribution of knowledge. Unable to believe in the Prophecy that promises these restrictions will someday end, he declares it to be a fraud and defies the High Lew under which they are enforced. His family and the girl to whom he is betrothed reject him. Yet he cannot turn back from the path that leads him to the mysterious fate awaiting heretics. But the more he learns of the grim truth about his people's deprivations, the less possible it seems that their world can be changed. And once he discovers what really happened in their past, he becomes convinced that it is up to him to restore their rightful heritage. To do so, however, will mean giving up all else that matters to him, for it will demand more drastic steps than anyone has imagined.",['Sylvia Engdahl'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EZx4EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=EZx4EAAAQBAJ&pg=PA291&dq=Children+of+the+Star&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Sylvia Engdahl,2012-06-15,http://books.google.nl/books?id=EZx4EAAAQBAJ&dq=Children+of+the+Star&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],
Casanova in Bolzano,"Another rediscovered masterpiece from the Hungarian novelist whose Embers became an international bestseller—a sensuous, suspenseful, aphoristic novel about the world’s most notorious seducer and the encounter that changes him forever. In 1756 Giacomo Casanova escapes from a Venetian prison and resurfaces in the Italian village of Bolzano. Here he receives an unwelcome visitor: the aging but still fearsome Duke of Parma, who years before had defeated Casanova in a duel over a ravishing girl named Francesca and spared his life on condition that he never see her again. Now the duke has taken Francesca as his wife—and intercepted a love letter from her to his old rival. Rather than kill Casanova on the spot, he makes him a startling offer, one that is logical, perverse, and irresistible. Turning an historical episode into a dazzling fictional exploration of the clasp of desire and death, Casanova in Bolzano is further proof that Sándor Márai is one of the most distinctive voices of the twentieth century.",['Sandor Marai'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fqbNnvUBokgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=fqbNnvUBokgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Casanova+in+Bolzano&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Vintage,2004-11-09,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fqbNnvUBokgC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],1.0

A Short Walk from Harrods,"First published in 1993, A Short Walk from Harrods is volume six of Dirk Bogarde's best-selling memoirs Forced to return to London because of his manager and his partner's rapidly deteriorating health, Bogarde learned to re-adapt to life in the west London neighbourhoods that groomed him as an aspiring young actor. With his fame fading and his descent into old age, the entire process had become rather difficult to endure. He writes of stalking the streets like an 'apologetic turtle' and avoiding society, announcing that he would, from then on, only do 'matinees' because he is too tired to go out in the evenings. Although this memoir finds Bogarde at his most vulnerable, he retains the lucidity and charm that makes his writing so enjoyable.

Flowers of the Dinh Ba Forest,"In this novel of war, love, camaraderie, and betrayal Vietnam veteran Clark centers his plot around a search for a rare orchid in the height of the Vietnam War. Monroe took the scene in with a glance and shifted the ruck on his back. 'The second night of the Watts riots. Pop loaded me in the car and we headed out. I figured I knew what he was up to. Everybody else was out in the streets looting and shit and I guessed we was going to get our share. But not him. You know what that man did?' Monroe's face broke a tired smile, and his head shook at the memory. 'He pulled in behind a greenhouse and busted a window out with a tire iron and we went in and stole all the orchids'. As novelist and veteran Tim O'Brien has pointed out, the telling element in any ture war story is that it doesn't make sense. Clark's characters-- both Vietnamese and American, both men and women--are painfully aware that nothing seems to make sense in the war, the one might as well trek off in search of a deep jungle orchid. It's this very non-sensicality that forges them--foe and friend--into an insane respect, an insane hatred for one another. And it's the search for this rare orchid that gives them the willed deception of meaning, much as if Soren Kierkegaard had leaped from late nineteenth century Sweden into twentieth century Vietnam. And the search also gives Clark's novel a gripping plot and range of characters--without any leap of faith, though with very much satisfaction.",['Robert David Clark'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=p_JlAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=p_JlAAAAMAAJ&q=Flowers+of+the+Dinh+Ba+Forest&dq=Flowers+of+the+Dinh+Ba+Forest&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Livingston Press,2004,http://books.google.nl/books?id=p_JlAAAAMAAJ&dq=Flowers+of+the+Dinh+Ba+Forest&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],
Monotype: Mediums and Methods for Painterly Printmaking (Practical Art Books),"Play is the central, universally significant activity of childhood. Self-directed play in which adults have a supporting rather than directing role is critical to the development and well-being of children. Yet as children have their days and nights increasingly scripted and planned for them, opportunities for play have disappeared over the last half century, especially in schools. ArtBreak’s innovation lies in its creative framework. Former school counselor, current professor of counseling, and practicing artist Katherine Ziff developed and tested the program over five years, integrating theory and practice from art therapy, counseling, and child-centered education. The result is a choice-based, guided play experience based on the developmental and restorative possibilities of art making. A detailed how-to guide, this book is the flexible and accessible toolbox that teachers, parents, and counselors need to facilitate relaxing, art-based play that allows children to freely explore, plan, and pursue their own interests with adult support. Easy to implement, ArtBreak can be added to the regular routines of classroom, home, therapy office, or other community setting at whatever scale suits space, time, and budget. No art training is required, only a willingness to embark on a play journey with children.",['Katherine Ziff'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0YBEDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=0YBEDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT110&dq=Monotype:+Mediums+and+Methods+for+Painterly+Printmaking+(Practical+Art+Books)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Ohio University Press,2016-07-15,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0YBEDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Social Science'],
Sea Wolf of the Confederacy: The Daring Civil War Raids of Naval Lt. Charles W. Read,"In June 1863, just days before the epic clash at Gettysburg ended the last rebel land invasion of the North, a small party of the Confederate Navy mounted a devastating series of raids on the New England coast, culminating in a battle off Portland, Maine. Veteran author David W. Shaw brilliantly re-creates this almost forgotten chapter of the Civil War in rich narrative detail drawn from accounts of the participants. At the center of the conflict were two men: the hotheaded young adventurer Charles W. Read, who resigned his commission as a Union midshipman to become a lieutenant in the Confederate Navy; and Secretary of the United States Navy Gideon Welles, a well-connected politician who ably oversaw the explosive growth of the fleet -- including the revolutionary ironclads -- during the war despite his lack of maritime experience. Serving aboard CSS Florida off the coast of Brazil, Read hatched a daring plan to sail a captured brig directly into the Union's home waters and wreak havoc on their shipping lanes. Burning or capturing more than twenty merchant vessels in less than three weeks, and switching ships several times to elude capture, Read's rampage caused widespread panic in Northern cities, made headlines in the major daily newspapers, and brought enormous pressure on Welles to ""stop the rebel pirate."" At one point there were nearly forty Union ships sent to hunt down Read in a cat-and-mouse game that finally led to his dramatic capture off the coast of Maine. Sea Wolf of the Confederacy brings to light this fascinating yet little known episode of the war, combining Shaw's flair for powerful storytelling with extensive research culled from contemporary newspapers, journals, and official war records. Taking readers to the heart of the action on the decks of the burning ships, Shaw offers a compelling portrait of the complex Read and an insightful new perspective on the divisions splitting North and South during this dark time in American history.",['David W.

The First World War (History of Warfare),"The definitive account of the Great War and a national bestseller from eminent military historian John Keegan 2018 marks the centenary of the First World War – the war that created the modern world. It destroyed a century of relative peace and prosperity and saw a continent at the height of its success descend into slaughter. It unleashed both the demons of the twentieth century - political hatred, military destruction and mass death - and the ideas which continue to shape our world today: modernism in the arts, new approaches to psychology and medicine, and radical ideas about economics and society. By the end of the war, three great empires – the Austro-Hungarian, the Russian and the Ottoman – had collapsed. But as Keegan expertly shows, the devastation extended over the entirety over Europe and still profoundly informs the politics and culture of the continent today. Pertinent, authoritative and gripping, this panoramic account of WW1 is regarded as a world history classic. ‘The best and most approachable introduction to the war’ Guardian ‘Nobody describes a battle as Keegan does, vividly relating the unfolding events to the contours of the field of combat...

Meanwhile, in the United States, Bollywood actor Joshua Borendhi narrowly escapes an early-morning assassination attempt and learns that he is a prime target for the lethal terror cell. A former terrorist himself, Joshua left the organization against the wishes of the leader and moved to New York to study acting. Shortly after the botched hit, the terrorists are on the prowl again, and this time the target is the Times Square subway. The FBI emerges on the scene, sidestepping the wily, old NYPD Sergeant Hoyden McDonald. In a frantic race across America, Joshua and Sergeant McDonald match the terrorists step for step. The final destination: Seattle. The FBI dispatches Joshua and Sergeant McDonald to identify and stop the war between the two countries with a violent history as war clouds loom on the horizon.

Somehow, he has to escape and get home but what will he find when he gets there?

"Facing The Extreme: One Woman's Tale of True Courage, Death-Defying Survival and Her Quest For The Summit","She stepped into a death zone. The climbers on Alaska's Mt. McKinley called her ""the woman."" Ruth Anne Kocour, a world-class mountaineer, wasn't bothered. It was part of the challenge she faced as she joined an all-male team to conquer North America's highest peak...the mountain the Indians called Denali, or God. Faced the extreme. But nine days into this ascent, a forty-fifth birthday present to herself, the most violent weather on record slammed into the mountain. Ruth Anne and her group would be trapped on an ice shelf at 14,000 feet for the deadliest two weeks in Denali history. Pinned down by blinding snows, unable to help other teams dying around her, and her own feet freezing solid, Ruth Anne tells of a wind chill of minus 150 degrees, deadly hidden crevasses, and being trapped in a place so violent and unforgiving that it threatened to push her over the edge and into a place of no return. And yet, in prose as crystalline as the ice around her, she tells, too, of beauty, courage, and the spirit that drives true mountainers higher, as she risks all to go for the summit...and perhaps, for a transcendant moment, touch heaven.

A pretender held the throne - a despot who cared little that barbarian hordes and rival realms carved away at his empire, so long as the wealth and booty of the land satisfied his unbridled appetites. Few stood against him. And those few soon found their heads on pikes. Only one name held hope for freedom: Maniakes. And from his exile on the very edge of the civilised world, young Maniakes took up the challenge, rallied his forces, and sailed off to topple the tyrant. But that tyrant would use every means at his disposal - fair or most hideously foul - to destroy the crusading upstart. And even if Maniakes could stay alive, he would till have to pull together a battered, divided land as well as fend off a host of enemies - and thwart the former friend who had become his empire's most deadly foe!",['Harry Turtledove'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QPzRBcP8EkQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=QPzRBcP8EkQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=HAMMER+AND+ANVIL+(Book+II+of+The+Time+of+Troubles)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Hachette UK,2013-05-31,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QPzRBcP8EkQC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],2.0

Winter Solstice,"In Winter Solstice Rosamunde Pilcher brings her readers into the lives of five very different people.... Elfrida Phipps, once of London's stage, moved to the English village of Dibton in hopes of making a new life for herself. Gradually she settled into the comfortable familiarity of village life -- shopkeepers knowing her tastes, neighbors calling her by name -- still she finds herself lonely. Oscar Blundell gave up his life as a musician in order to marry Gloria. They have a beautiful daughter, Francesca, and it is only because of their little girl that Oscar views his sacrificed career as worthwhile. Carrie returns from Austria at the end of an ill-fated affair with a married man to find her mother and aunt sharing a home and squabbling endlessly. With Christmas approaching, Carrie agrees to look after her aunt's awkward and quiet teenage daughter, Lucy, so that her mother might enjoy a romantic fling in America. Sam Howard is trying to pull his life back together after his wife has left him for another. He is without home and without roots, all he has is his job. Business takes him to northern Scotland, where he falls in love with the lush, craggy landscape and set his sights on a house. It is the strange rippling effects of a tragedy that will bring these five characters together in a large, neglected estate house near the Scottish fishing town of Creagan. It is in this house, on the shortest day of the year, that the lives of five people will come together and be forever changed.

Agricultural development in South Asia: A comparative study in the green revolution experiences,"Agricultural development in South Asia (a comparative study in the green revolution experiences) is a pioneer work of its own kind and unique in nature. Its salient features are: It is a comprehensive and self-contained study covering an analysis of determinants of agriculture and agricultural attributes -- so, a cause-effect analysis. Agricultural development regions and agro-ecological regions have been delineated, and specific recommendations have been made for redressing the regionalimbalances in levels of agricultural development in the South Asian countries--so a planning-oriented study. The study is based on field truthing, personal communications, district-by-district data etc. The data have been presented in maps enlightening patterns and dynamics of agricultural inputs and outputs, and the cartographic work is of high quality. So far, no such in-depth study has been conducted, covering only the primary activity of the sub-continent and highlighting the green evolution experiences--so, a study related to the then and now as regards agricultural inputs and outputs. It will be a study of great relevance to the SAARC nations for planning purposes and making master plans for reducing regional inequalities in agricultural performance levels. Since this work is a pioneer attempt and is based on the field work and district-by district data covering the green revolution period (1967-68 to 1987-88), it is a work of its own kind and unique in nature. The greatest inequality in the use of agricultural inputs within the borders of South Asia is responsible for agricultural development differences. These range from the poverty in densely populated Bangladesh to agriculturally high-speed Punjab-Haryana region in Northwestern India. Moreover, South Asia includes the cold empties of the high Himalayan ranges where agricultural development has a special meaning. The agricultural face of South Asia has changed at a different rate because the diffusion of green revolution technology was not a universal scale. As a consequence, four levels of agricultural development were observed, such as: Very high level development with high speed change; High/medium level development with high/medium speed change; Low level development with low speed change, and Very low level development with very low speed change. Therefore, it is no longer desirable to write only a static geography of agricultural development of South Asia, and it is also equally important, above, all to examine, explain, identify and understand the recognisable ceaseless patterns of change in agricultural development levels.",['Jasbir Singh'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pCzbAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=pCzbAAAAMAAJ&q=Agricultural+development+in+South+Asia:+A+comparative+study+in+the+green+revolution+experiences&dq=Agricultural+development+in+South+Asia:+A+comparative+study+in+the+green+revolution+experiences&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,1997,http://books.google.nl/books?id=pCzbAAAAMAAJ&dq=Agricultural+development+in+South+Asia:+A+comparative+study+in+the+green+revolution+experiences&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Agricultural ecology'],
The Self and its Body in Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit (Toronto Studies in Philosophy),"A major criticism of Hegel's philosophy is that it fails to comprehend the experience of the body. In this book, John Russon shows that there is in fact a philosophy of embodiment implicit in Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit. Russon argues that Hegel has not only taken account of the body, but has done so in a way that integrates both modern work on embodiment and the approach to the body found in ancient Greek philosophy. Although Russon approaches Hegel's Phenomenology from a contemporary standpoint, he places both this standpoint and Hegel's work within a classical tradition. Using the Aristotelian terms of 'nature' and 'habit,' Russon refers to the classical distinction between biological nature and a cultural 'second nature.' It is this second nature that constitutes, in Russon's reading of Hegel, the true embodiment of human intersubjectivity. The development of spirit, as mapped out by Hegel, is interpreted here as a process by which the self establishes for itself an embodiment in a set of social and political institutions in which it can recognize and satisfy its rational needs. Russon concludes by arguing that self-expression and self-interpretation are the ultimate needs of the human spirit, and that it is the degree to which these needs are satisfied that is the ultimate measure of the adequacy of the institutions that embody human life. This link with classicism - in itself a serious contribution to the history of philosophy -provides an excellent point of access into the Hegelian system. Russon's work, which will prove interesting reading for any Hegel scholar, provides a solid and reliable introduction to the study of Hegel.",['John Russon'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Rxx0dMgJH4wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Rxx0dMgJH4wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Self+and+its+Body+in+Hegel%27s+Phenomenology+of+Spirit+(Toronto+Studies+in+Philosophy)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,University of Toronto Press,2001-01-01,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Rxx0dMgJH4wC&dq=The+Self+and+its+Body+in+Hegel%27s+Phenomenology+of+Spirit+(Toronto+Studies+in+Philosophy)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Philosophy'],

Better Together : Restoring the American Community,"In his acclaimed bestselling book, Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community, Robert Putnam described a thirty-year decline in America's social institutions. The book ended with the hope that new forms of social connection might be invented in order to revive our communities. In Better Together, Putnam and longtime civic activist Lewis Feldstein describe some of the diverse locations and most compelling ways in which civic renewal is taking place today. In response to civic crises and local problems, they say, hardworking, committed people are reweaving the social fabric all across America, often in innovative ways that may turn out to be appropriate for the twenty-first century. Better Together is a book of stories about people who are building communities to solve specific problems. The examples Putnam and Feldstein describe span the country from big cities such as Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Chicago to the Los Angeles suburbs, small Mississippi and Wisconsin towns, and quiet rural areas. The projects range from the strictly local to that of the men and women of UPS, who cover the nation. Bowling Alone looked at America from a broad and general perspective. Better Together takes us into Catherine Flannery's Roxbury, Massachusetts, living room, a UPS loading dock in Greensboro, North Carolina, a Philadelphia classroom, the Portsmouth, New Hampshire, naval shipyard, and a Bay Area Web site. We meet activists driven by their visions, each of whom has chosen to succeed by building community: Mexican Americans in the Rio Grande Valley who want paved roads, running water, and decent schools; Harvard University clerical workers searching for respect and improved working conditions; Waupun, Wisconsin, schoolchildren organizing to improve safety at a local railroad crossing; and merchants in Tupelo, Mississippi, joining with farmers to improve their economic status. As the stories in Better Together demonstrate, bringing people together by building on personal relationships remains one of the most effective strategies to enhance America's social health.","['Robert D.

Swinging for the Fences: Black Baseball in Minnesota,"From the early formation of barnstorming teams that toured the state to the moment Dave Winfield hit number three thousand, Minnesota's African American ball players have made the state a land of baseball. However, the stories of many black players parallel the larger struggle for civil rights. Those tales, collected here for the first time, show how teamwork on and off the field led first to acceptance, then to admiration and triumph. Swinging for the Fences is the first collection to highlight the thrilling and controversial landmarks in the history of black baseball in the North Star State. Award-winning author Steven R. Hoffbeck assembled a stellar team of writers--and baseball fanatics--to tell the great stories of black baseball's past, from establishment of the color lines to dazzling hits by black heroes that led the Twins to victory over the Cardinals in '87. Each chapter focuses on one key player, and through these windows into their lives and livelihoods, their plays and passions, readers get an intimate look at the national pastime as it has evolved over the last century and more. Featured here are Hall of Famers like Willie Mays, Roy Campanella, and Kirby Puckett and great players like Walter Ball, John Wesley Donaldson, and Bud Fowler, who, because of their race, never made the stats books. These are stories of the bonds that formed between players, of legendary moments in baseball's past, and of real people whose love of the game kept them playing against tough odds.",['Steven R.

The Other,"ÿ In a religious pluralistic society the other cannot be ignored, even less so when there is a familial relationship between religions. The way in which Judaism and Christianity relate can be conceptualised in many different forms, depending on the theory one subscribes to. Did Judaism and Christianity derive from a common ancestor? Did Christianity spring from Judaism and, if so, when? Why did the final cut between the two take place? Did Christianity replace Judaism? If so, how can the relationship between them now be described? Before interaction between the two religions is possible, an honest and unbiased attempt to understand each other must be mutual. This is a painful and difficult exercise as Christians and Jews seem to have been at odds since forever.

Biology as Ideology: The Doctrine of DNA,"R. C. Lewontin is a prominent scientist -- a geneticist who teaches at Harvard -- yet he believes that we have placed science on a pedestal, treating it as an objective body of knowledge that transcends all other ways of knowing and all other endeavours. Lewontin writes in this collection of essays, which began their life as CBC Radio's Massey Lectures Series for 1990: ""Scientists do not begin life as scientists, after all, but as social beings immersed in a family, a state, a productive structure, and they view nature through a lens that has been molded by their social experience... . Science, like the Church before it, is a supremely social institution, reflecting and reinforcing the dominant values and vices of society at each historical epoch."" In Biology as Ideology Lewontin examines the false paths down which modern scientific ideology has led us. By admitting science's limitations, he helps us rediscover the richness of nature -- and appreciate the real value of science.",['Richard Lewontin'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eUWfFQQxm1EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=eUWfFQQxm1EC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Biology+as+Ideology:+The+Doctrine+of+DNA&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,House of Anansi,1996-10-23,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eUWfFQQxm1EC&source=gbs_api,['Science'],

The Purity Principle: God's Safeguards for Life's Dangerous Trails (LifeChange Books),"For thirty years Randy Alcorn has been encouraging people-young and old-to pursue the rewards of sexual purity. Too often we settle for a compromised Christianity that's just a baptized version of the world's sad existence, rather than the abundant life to which God calls us. This book deals with - raising children to embrace sexual purity - providing an example of purity in the home - protecting purity in dating (at any age) - and maintaining purity in marriage. Biblical, practical, and concise, The Purity Principle is a one-stop handbook for individuals, families and churches. Some people have given up on purity. Some have never tried. Bestselling author Randy Alcorn shows us why, in this culture of impurity, the stakes are so high—and what we can do to experience the freedom of purity. Impurity will always destroy us; purity always leads to higher pleasures! Choose wisely.

The Secret World of the Irish Male (Reed Audio),"De grootse nieuwe roman van de auteur van De jongen in de gestreepte pyjama en De grote stilte Voor de liefhebbers van De as van mijn moeder van Frank McCourt Ierland, 1945. Cyril wordt geboren als bastaardzoon van een verstoten tienermeisje. Het welgestelde echtpaar Avery adopteert hem, maar Cyril vraagt zich vaak af waarom, want zijn adoptieouders laten geen gelegenheid onbenut om hem op het hart te drukken dat hij geen echte Avery is. Hij voelt zich ook geen Avery, en hij voelt zich ook niet thuis in het katholieke naoorlogse Ierland. Pas als hij de flamboyante charmeur Julian Woodbead ontmoet, is de eerste stap naar de zoektocht van zijn identiteit gezet – een zoektocht die hem tot in Amsterdam en New York voert, in een poging het geluk en de liefde te vinden. John Boyne verbeeldt op fenomenale wijze de verlossende kracht van de menselijke geest, en laat de lezer en passant voelen hoe onwelkom de wereld kan zijn voor zoekende zielen.

The Titan (Meridian classics),"Frank Algernon Cowperwood, the central character of Theodore Dreiser's previous work ""The Financier,"" is now out of the Eastern District Penitentiary of Philadelphia. He still has his mistress and his fortune, plans to divorce his wife, and leaves for Chicago to scout its possibilities for a future home. He has letters of introduction to the most influential people--a bank president named Mr. Addison, for a start. Cowperwood is presented to others--lawyers, businessmen, and judges. At this beginning not one of them knew he had been incarcerated, and he wondered if that knowledge would affect their attitude towards him. He finally confesses his recent history to Addison and decides to establish his new company in Chicago. He carefully and thoroughly scrutinizes the conditions for establishing a wealth that would be envied by powerful men and selfish women. ""The magnetizing power of fame is great."" As Cowperwood climbs the glorified mountain and sets out to ultimately conquer this new world, his past foibles overcome him again--his desire for beautiful women, his acquisition of unbelievable wealth, his need to be accepted and understood and revered. His genius for social and financial manipulations fails him in politics. The ending is a philosophical overview of what has happened and what can happen to a man with a restless heart. Please Note: This book has been reformatted to be easy to read in true text, not scanned images that can sometimes be difficult to decipher.

The state’s official travel magazine published its first Texas Highways Cookbook in 1986. Responding to the public’s demand for a new collection of the magazine’s recipes, the editors compiled Cooking with Texas Highways, a collection of more than 250 recipes that are as richly diverse and flavorful as Texas itself. Cooking with Texas Highways samples all the major ethnic cuisines of the state with recipes from home cooks, well-known chefs, and popular restaurants. It offers a varied and intriguing selection of snacks and beverages, breads, soups and salads, main dishes, vegetables and sides, sauces and spreads, desserts, and more. A special feature of this cookbook is a chapter on Dutch-oven cooking, which covers all the basics for cooking outdoors with live coals, including seventeen mouthwatering recipes. In addition, you’ll find dozens of the lovely color photographs that have long made Texas Highways such a feast for the eyes, along with tips on cooking techniques and sources for ingredients and stories about some of the folks who created the recipes. If you want to sample all the tastes of Texas, there’s no better place to start than Cooking with Texas Highways. “Texas culture in all its multi-ethnic variety is well represented.” —Texas Cooking",['Nola McKey'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DOirVwOoqSgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=DOirVwOoqSgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Cooking+with+Texas+Highways&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,University of Texas Press,2010-07-22,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DOirVwOoqSgC&source=gbs_api,['Cooking'],

The Days of Summer,"The official book tie-in to the acclaimed romantic comedy from Fox Searchlight Pictures, an audience hit at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt (3rd Rock from the Sun, 10 Things I Hate About You) and Zooey Deschanel (Yes Man, The Happening, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy). ""This is a story of boy meets girl,"" begins the wry, probing narrator of (500) Days of Summer, and with that the film takes off at breakneck speed into a funny, true-to-life, and unique dissection of the unruly and unpredictable year and a half of one young man's no-holds-barred love affair.

Bringing Reggio Emilia Home: An Innovative Approach to Early Childhood Education (Early Childhood Education Series),"Bringing Reggio Emilia Home is the first book to integrate the experiences of one American teacher on a year-long internship in the preschools of Reggio, with a four-year adaptation effort in one American school. The lively text includes many ""mini-stories"" of preschool and kindergarten-age children, teachers, and parents who embark on journeys of learning together. These journeys take shape in language, in drawings, in tempera paint and clay, in outdoor excursions, and in the imaginations of both the children and adults. This informative and accessible work features photographs of the children (both in Italy and the United States) and samples of the childrens work, including some in full colour. During the past 10 years there has been a tremendous interest among early childhood educators and parents in the innovative approaches to teaching pioneered in the preschools of Reggio Emilia, Italy. This book is a must read for anyone interested in the Reggio Approach! Teachers, especially those in early childhood, teacher educators, policy makers, administrators, and parents will find it invaluable.",['Louise Boyd Cadwell'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_L0claCWVt4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=_L0claCWVt4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Bringing+Reggio+Emilia+Home:+An+Innovative+Approach+to+Early+Childhood+Education+(Early+Childhood+Education+Series)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Teachers College Press,1997-09-19,http://books.google.nl/books?id=_L0claCWVt4C&dq=Bringing+Reggio+Emilia+Home:+An+Innovative+Approach+to+Early+Childhood+Education+(Early+Childhood+Education+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Education'],

Messages from the People of the Planet Clarion: The True Experiences of Truman Bethurum,"While driving to his new place of employment, Truman Bethurum stopped about 70 miles from Las Vegas, near Mormon Mesa. Around 3.00am while he was sleeping in his car he heard strange voices coming from outside his vehicle. Looking up he saw about 15 feet away an egg-shaped craft resting on the ground. A member of the group approached him, extended his hand as a sign of friendship and told Truman not to be afraid, that they were peaceful and from a faraway place. In subsequent contacts, Bethurum discovered that the friendly ETs were from the Planet Clarion, and that they had much to share with us in the way of science, technology, ecology and health. Before his death he shared this information with as many people as possible. Much of this material has not, as yet, been widely distributed.",['Truman Bethurum'],,http://books.google.nl/books?id=HqQ0zwEACAAJ&dq=Messages+from+the+People+of+the+Planet+Clarion:+The+True+Experiences+of+Truman+Bethurum&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,1995-12,http://books.google.nl/books?id=HqQ0zwEACAAJ&dq=Messages+from+the+People+of+the+Planet+Clarion:+The+True+Experiences+of+Truman+Bethurum&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Extraterrestrial beings'],

"The Secret Architecture of Our Nation's Capital: The Masons and the Building of Washington, D.C.","Today, there are more than twenty complete zodiacs in Washington, D.C., each one pointing to an extraordinary mystery. David Ovason, who has studied these astrological devices for ten years, now reveals why they have been placed in such abundance in the center of our nation's capital and explains their interconnections. His richly illustrated text tells the story of how Washington, from its foundation in 1791, was linked with the zodiac, with the meaning of certain stars, and with a hidden cosmological symbolism that he uncovers here for the first time. Fascinating and thoroughly researched, The Secret Architecture of Our Nation 's Capital is an engrossing book that raises provocative questions and otters complex insights into the meanings behind the mysterious symbols in Washington.",['David Ovason'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1Mg9oMrhVScC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1Mg9oMrhVScC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Secret+Architecture+of+Our+Nation%27s+Capital:+The+Masons+and+the+Building+of+Washington,+D.C.&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Harper Collins,2012-02-14,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1Mg9oMrhVScC&source=gbs_api,['History'],4.0
